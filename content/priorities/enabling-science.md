description: JASMIN and the CEDA  Archive enable scientists to carry out research that would not otherwise be possible. This could include monitoring UK biodiversity trends, developing the next generation of climate models, improving our understanding of extreme weather. Or it could even be predicting volcanoes or earthquakes, modeling plant health, and gauging the impact of climate change on food production, amongst many others!
