Summary: IS-ENES3 is the third phase of the distributed e-infrastructure of the European Network for Earth System Modelling (ENES). The project involves collaboration between twenty-two European climate research institutions and aims to develop a better understanding of past and present-day climate and to project future variability and changes through the development and sharing of model components, modelling tools and data infrastructure.

Aim: To foster collaboration among the modelling groups to speed-up the development and use of models of the complex Earth’s climate system, namely “Earth System models” (ESMs), Deliver common strategies for the research infrastructure and Disseminate model data

CEDA role: Supporting the publication, replication, documentation and distribution of CMIP6 data by running services and developing software and standards to support those services.
