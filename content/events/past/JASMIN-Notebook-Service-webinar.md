<p><span>In this webinar, we will talk you through some of the <a href="https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4851-jasmin-notebook-service">JASMIN Notebook Service&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;key features. <br /><br /></span>The JASMIN Notebook service provides access to <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> in the web browser. A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive document containing live code, documentation and visualisations that can be run and edited in a web browser.</p>

<p>The following examples will be covered in the webinar: <br /> 1. Using Python in the browser <br /> 2. Plotting in a Notebook <br /> 3. Working with data in the CEDA Archive <br /> 4. Accessing data in Group Workspaces <br /> 5. Creating virtual environments to install additional software <br /><br />Note: This new service is currently in beta, so access will be limited. Please also be understanding if there are teething issues.</p>
