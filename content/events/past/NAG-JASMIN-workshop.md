<p><span>NAG have just announced the availability of the new<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://support.nag.com/numeric/py/nagdoc_latest/index.html" target="_blank"><span>NAG Library for Python</span></a><span>. The re-engineering of the NAG Library for Python offers many usability improvements enabling quicker application development including, self-contained routine documentation, thread-safety, curated examples demonstrating important algorithmic and Python-related functionality, support for native Python callbacks and C language routine equivalents giving a unified route from prototyping in Python to deploying as compiled code.  </span></p>
<p><span>NAG Library for Python key features and benefits of this release:</span></p>
<p><span>&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully Pythonic interfaces optimized for usability</span></p>
<p><span>&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full integration with native Python IO</span></p>
<p><span>&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexible data types, particularly for string and integer input, and NumPy-compatible array-like arguments accepted</span></p>
<p><span>&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support for native Python callbacks</span></p>
<p><span>&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;namedtuple function return data</span></p>
<p><span>&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curated examples within the package give short demonstrations of important algorithmic and Python-related functionality</span></p>
<p><span>&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ability to utilize Intel MKL through the Library</span></p>
<p><span>&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-contained API documentation &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row-ordered or column-ordered input permitted</span></p>
<p><span>All routines have C &nbsp;and Fortran equivalents, giving a unified route from prototyping your code in Python to deploying as compiled code.</span></p>
