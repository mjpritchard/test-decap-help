<p>This webinar&nbsp;provides&nbsp;an introduction to using Git and GitHub to manage, share and backup your code. We will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Why you should use version control </span></li>
<li><span>What GitHub is </span></li>
<li><span>How to get started with GitHub </span></li>
<li><span>Additional useful commands </span></li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the webinar you should be able to organise your code into a git repository and see it on GitHub along with knowing how to edit and update the repository. This will allow you to keep track of changes and easily share your code with others. This is a basic introduction, a more detailed look is found down below.</p>
<p><span>Within CEDA*, we use GitHub extensively to manage the code behind all our services; both internal and external. We are therefore well placed in providing support or answering any questions you may have about using GitHub for version control. </span></p>

<p>At the end of the webinar, you should be able to use a combination of Git commands and GitHub features to manage your code. Creating issues to manage priorities and branches to allow testing and development on multiple fronts. You will also have been introduced to making changes to other GitHub projects and submitting your changes for review by the original project.</p>
