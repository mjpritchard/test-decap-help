The Group Workspace (GWS) Alert system is a python app which alerts the managers/deputies of a GWS when their GWS is reaching full capacity.

Please note this service is under beta-testing (June 2024) so if you receive any emails in error please let us know

## What is the GWS Alert System?

A GWS is a collaborative storage made available to a group for a project. Each GWS has a certain quota of storage - more information about how the storage is being used within a GWS can be found using the [GWS Scanner UI](https://gws-scanner.jasmin.ac.uk/). The GWS Alert System is set up to notify the managers/deputies of a GWS when it is reaching full capacity so the managers can make some more space available.

## How the GWS Alert System runs

The Python app gets a list of all GWSs from the {{<link "jasmin_projects_portal">}}JASMIN Projects Portal{{</link>}}, gets the storage information - i.e. how much storage has been used and how much is available, then sends an email alert if the GWS is over a certain percentage full. The managers and deputies are obtained from the {{<link "jasmin_accounts_portal">}}JASMIN Projects Portal{{</link>}}.

The GWS Alert System runs on a schedule at 11am daily.

### Threshold value

The threshold value at which alerts are sent is obtained from a file within the GWS. The file is found at `{GWS_PATH}/.gws_scan/config.ini`. The file should look something like this, for a threshold of **80%**:

```ini
[general]
volume_warning_threshold = 80
```

where the `volume_warning_threshold` (without the `%` symbol) is the threshold value used in the GWS Alert system.

If no file can be found, the default value of `90` is used.

## Issues and questions

If you receive an email in error, or you think the email may contain incorrect information, please let us know.

If you'd like to change the threshold value, please update the `volume_warning_threshold` value in the `config.ini` file as described above. If the value hasn't been updated the following day, please let us know.

If you make changes to your storage and these aren't reflected in the next alert, please let us know.
