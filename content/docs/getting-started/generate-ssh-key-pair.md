This article explains how to create an SSH key pair for logging in to JASMIN.

You can also use this procedure to update an existing SSH key pair for JASMIN.
However, if you are experiencing problems logging in to JASMIN you are advised
to first check {{<link "../interactive-computing/login-problems">}}Login problems{{</link>}} before changing your
key. Once you have created your SSH key pair, the public key will need to be uploaded to
your {{<link "https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/account/login/?next=/account/profile/">}}JASMIN profile{{</link>}}.
If this is the first time you have created a key
pair then this will be done when you create an account on the accounts portal (Step 2
of {{<link "get-started-with-jasmin">}}Get Started with JASMIN{{</link>}}).

## SSH client and terminal

Generating an SSH key pair requires an SSH client, usually an application which functions as a terminal: 
a text-based environment where you type commands to make things happen. Linux
and Mac users can use a standard terminal which is very likely to have SSH
installed. Windows users are advised to find a suitable SSH client to use or
install on their machine. Suggestions are:

- {{<link "../uncategorized/mobaxterm">}}MobaXterm{{</link>}} (requires license), provides a Linux-style terminal
with all the relevant command-line and some GUI utilities included. Figures 1 and 2, below, show example
terminal windows on a Mac, and Windows (using MobaXterm).
- {{<link "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement">}}Windows OpenSSH client{{</link>}} an optional feature in Windows 10 or 11, but usually installed by default.
- {{<link "https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">}}PuTTY{{</link>}} set of SSH tools (includes PuTTYgen GUI tool for generating keys, and Pageant ssh-agent)

There are many more, but if you stick to one of these three, which are known to us, then potentially we can help you if you run into difficulties.

## Using ssh-keygen to create an SSH key pair

{{<alert type="info">}}
As of November 2024 you are now recommended to use an ECDSA key (instead of RSA), for better compatibility with some services.
Please note the updated command and filenames generated.
{{</alert>}}

The Linux command `ssh-keygen` should be used to generate your SSH key pair.
Open a terminal and generate your public and private key, as follows:

{{<command user="localuser" host="localhost">}}
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t ecdsa -b 521 -f ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin
{{</command>}}

(Here, `~/` or `$HOME` both mean "your home directory". The equivalent on Windows is `%USERPROFILE%`)

The equivalent using the graphical PuTTYgen or MobaKeyGen tools is with these settings: choose these **before** clicking "Generate"
{{< image src="img/docs/generate-ssh-key-pair/puttygen-ecdsa-key.png" caption="Settings for ECDSA key in PuTTYgen (same for MobaKeyGen). Choose settings before clicking Generate." wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}
When prompted, type a **secure passphrase** to protect your SSH private key.
**This is a requirement for access to JASMIN machines. Use a new, different
passphrase whenever you generate a new key.** Note that nothing is echoed to
the screen when you enter your passphrase, so it may look like it is not
working.

The output from the command-line tools will look something like this:
{{<command user="localuser" host="localhost">}}
(out)Generating public/private ecdsa key pair.
(out)Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): <ADD PASSPHRASE HERE>
(out)Enter same passphrase again: <REPEAT PASSPHRASE HERE>
(out)Your identification has been saved in /home/users/meuser/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin.
(out)Your public key has been saved in /home/users/meuser/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin.pub.
(out)The key fingerprint is:
(out)74:14:95:8a:31:73:cc:5c:af:be:91:04:01:c2:39:0b me@somewhere.ac.uk
{{</command>}}

Running `ssh-keygen` will generate two files in your `$HOME/.ssh/` directory:

- `id_ecdsa_jasmin` -  private key file (which should have permission "600", i.e. read/write only by you)
- `id_ecdsa_jasmin.pub` - public key file

The **public** key file is the part that you need to share in order to access
JASMIN. Windows may mistakenly associated the `*.pub` file with Microsoft Publisher so don't try to double-click it. When you need to copy & paste its contents to upload to your JASMIN profile, use a simple text editor (like Notepad).

Make sure the file is stored in a directory called `.ssh` in your home directory (`~/.ssh`, `$HOME/.ssh` or `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh` on Windows, or `${env:UserProfile}\.ssh` in PowerShell). Storing it elsewhere sometimes causes problems with permissions, but it's also good to keep keys in one place so that they can be kept securely.

{{<alert color="warning" icon="fas lock">}}
The **private** key file should be protected and not shared with
others. It should stay on your local machine: **Do not copy your private key to anywhere on JASMIN.**
