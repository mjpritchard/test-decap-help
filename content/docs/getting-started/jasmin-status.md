## JASMIN dashboard

The {{<link "https://mon.jasmin.ac.uk" >}}JASMIN metrics dashboard{{</link>}} has been redeveloped and is now available again. 

Please read the introductory information on that page.

Currrently it provides:
- GWS Dashboard
  - view of all the volumes in a group workspace across different storage types, showing quota and usage
- LOTUS Dashboard
  - showing pending and running jobs per partition (queue) and other useful metrics
- Power Dashboard
  - showing power consumption of the various components of JASMIN
- Tape dashboard
  - showing summary information on tape usage by consortium

This is still under active development and further dashboards may be added in due course.

Please also keep an eye on:
- `JASMIN-USERS` email list (all users should be on this list. If not, please ask)
- {{< link ceda_news >}}CEDA News{{< /link >}} articles on the CEDA website
- {{< link ceda_x >}}@cedanews on X (formerly Twitter){{</link>}}
