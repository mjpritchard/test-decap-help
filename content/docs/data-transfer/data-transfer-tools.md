{{<link "globus-transfers-with-jasmin">}}Globus{{</link>}} | An efficient, secure data transfer service available to all JASMIN users **(recommended)**. Includes capability to schedule, repeat and orchestrate transfers between third-party hosts and receive notifications of job status. Has web and command-line interfaces. Efficient for moving large volumes and/or numbers of files, especially over long distances.
{{<link "rsync-scp-sftp">}}scp{{</link>}} |  A basic transfer tool that works over the SSH protocol. Similar to "cp" but copies between remote servers.  
{{<link "rsync-scp-sftp">}}rsync (over SSH){{</link>}} |  Like scp but more sophisticated. Allows synchronisation between remote directory trees.  
{{<link "rsync-scp-sftp">}}sftp{{</link>}} |  SSH FTP - works over SSH.  
{{<link "bbcp">}}bbcp{{</link>}} |  A command-line tool that allows the user to specify parallel transfer over multiple streams, using SSH authentication.
{{<link "gridftp-ssh-auth">}}GridFTP (over SSH){{</link>}} |  An old but comprehensive data transfer tool. Highly configurable and able to transfer over multiple parallel streams. Used over SSH in this case. Superseded by {{<link "globus-transfers-with-jasmin">}}Globus{{</link>}}
{{<link "gridftp-cert-based-auth">}}GridFTP (certificate-based){{</link>}} |  Legacy Gridftp using certificate-based authentication instead of SSH credentials. Efficient for moving large volumes and/or numbers of files, especially over long distances.  Superseded by {{<link "globus-transfers-with-jasmin">}}Globus{{</link>}}
{{<link "ftp-and-lftp">}}FTP{{</link>}} |  File Transfer Protocol. An aged transfer protocol suitable for small file transfers but limited.
{{<link "ftp-and-lftp">}}LFTP{{</link>}} |  Parallel-capable FTP client.
wget, curl  |  Download tools for accessing resources over HTTP primarily. (see 3rd party documentation)
{{<link "../short-term-project-storage/share-gws-data-via-http">}}sharing GWS data via http{{</link>}} | for exposing part(s) of a Group Workspace via HTTP to users without JASMIN accounts.
Python transfer tools  |  Methods of managing/scripting data transfer tasks using Python. You can use libraries such as `requests` in a Python 3 virtual environment on the transfer servers.  
{{<link "../mass/external-access-to-mass-faq">}}MASS client (Met Office){{</link>}}|  A specific command-line tool installed on the mass-cli1.ceda.ac.uk server on JASMIN. Enables extractions from the Met Office MASS Archive.
OPeNDAP  |  A transfer protocol for extracting subsets of files from a remote server (over HTTP)
{{<link "rclone">}}rclone{{</link>}} |  A 3rd party, open-source command-line utility which can interface to, and synchronise data between, a wide variety of cloud and other storage backends, such as Google Drive and AWS S3 compatible object stores. It can also sync data over SSH.   This utility is not installed on JASMIN but is well-documented and trivial for users to download and configure themselves on one of the {{<link "../interactive-computing/transfer-servers">}}data transfer servers{{</link>}} **Please note {{<link "rclone#installing-rclone-for-yourself-on-jasmin">}}install instructions{{</link>}}, and {{<link "rclone/#dos-and-donts">}}dos and don'ts{{</link>}}for rclone on JASMIN**.
