title: How to submit an MPI parallel job
---

This article explains the submission of an MPI parallel job to SLURM/ LOTUS.
It covers:

  * What is an MPI parallel job?
  * MPI implementation and SLURM
  * Parallel MPI job submission 

# What is an MPI parallel job?

An MPI parallel job runs on more than one core and more than one host using
the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library for communication between all
cores. A simple script, such as the one given below "my_script_name.sbatch  "

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p par-multi
#SBATCH -n 36
#SBATCH -t 30
#SBATCH -o %j.log
#SBATCH -e %j.err

# Load a module for the gcc OpenMPI library  (needed for mpi_myname.exe)
module load eb/OpenMPI/gcc/4.0.0

# Start the job running using OpenMPI's "mpirun" job launcher
mpirun ./mpi_myname.exe
```

`-n` refers to the number of processors or cores you wish to run on. The rest
of  the `#SBATCH` input  options, and many more besides, can be found in  the
`sbatch` manual  page or in the related articles. You must only use the par-
multi queue for parallel jobs using MPI.

For those familiar with LOTUS running Platform MPI and Platform LSF, please
note that the job is started using the OpenMPI native "mpirun" command not the
"mpirun.lotus" wrapper script that was previously required. We have provided
an mpirun.lotus script for backward compatiblity but it just runs the native
mpirun

To submit the job, do not run the script, but rather use it as the standard
input to sbatch, like so:

```bash
sbatch --exclusive my_script_name.sbatch
```

The `--exclusive` flag  is used to group the parallel jobs onto hosts which
are allocated only to run this job. This ensures the best MPI communication
consistency and bandwidth/latency for the job and ensures no interference from
other users' jobs that might otherwise be running on those hosts.

# MPI implementation and SLURM

The OpenMPI library is the only supported MPI library on the cluster. OpenMPI
v3.1.1 and v4.0.0 are provided which are fully MPI3 compliant. MPI I/O
features are fully supported *only* on the LOTUS /work/scratch-pw* volumes as
these use a Panasas fully parallel file system. The MPI implementation on
CentOS7 LOTUS/SLURM is available via the module environment for each compiler
as listed below:

```bash
eb/OpenMPI/gcc/3.1.1 
eb/OpenMPI/gcc/4.0.0       
eb/OpenMPI/intel/3.1.1
```

**Note:** OPenMPI Intel compiler is due shortly as is 4.0.3  

# Parallel MPI compiler with OpenMPI

Compile and link to OpenMPI libraries using the mpif90, mpif77, mpicc, mpiCC
wrapper scripts which are in the default unix path. The scripts will detect
which compiler you are using (Gnu, Intel) by the compiler environment loaded
and add the relevant compiler library switches. For example:

```bash
module load intel/20.0.0
module load eb/OpenMPI/intel/3.1.1
mpif90
```

will use the Intel Fortran compiler `ifort` and OpenMPI/3.1.1.  Whereas

```bash
module load eb/OpenMPI/gcc/3.1.1
mpicc
```

will call the GNU C compiler `gcc` and  OpenMPI/3.1.1.
