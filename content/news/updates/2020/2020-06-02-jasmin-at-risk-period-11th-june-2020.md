We [previously announced](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/jasmin-low-at-risk-period-22nd-25th-may-2020/) electrical work planned for the RAL site around the Bank Holiday weekend of 22nd-25th May, which carried with it a small risk of disruption to JASMIN’s power supply. In fact, the main part of this work has now been re-scheduled to **Thursday 11th June 2020**. The risk of disruption is small but if it occurs would result in all JASMIN and CEDA services being offline for several days if power was lost.  
   
During this period, work is being undertaken on the STFC RAL site (JASMIN’s host institution) as part of the construction of the new [Rosalind Franklin Institute](https://www.rfi.ac.uk/). Electrical work aims to connect this new facility to the site high-voltage supply which also supplies JASMIN. There is a small risk of loss of power to the JASMIN data centre while this work is undertaken. Loss of power would disrupt all CEDA and JASMIN services, and other STFC network services, which support remote working for STFC and JASMIN support staff, for many days if it happened.


To mitigate impact, STFC Estates, in association with the electrical contractor, SSE, will provide suitable generator capacity on 10th June to cover the period on 11th June for which the main feed will be down.


Recovery from a power interruption would take several days, especially because of the implications of social distancing protocols currently required.


With apologies for any inconvenience caused,


JASMIN Team
