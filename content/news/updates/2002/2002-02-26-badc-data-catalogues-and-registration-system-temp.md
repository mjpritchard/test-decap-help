Due to database problems,the "Application for access to restricted datasets" system (including New User Registration) is
 temporarily unavailable. 



 For the same reason, the BADC Datasets catalogue is also temporarily unavailable. 
For the time being, please use the link to [List of all datasets](/data/dataset_index) 
in BADC catalogue. Please note that the link to Catalogue Record is not available due to the same problems. 



 The Met Office Station catalogue is also temporarily unavailable. 
 For the time being, please use the link to [List of Station names and numbers](/data/surface/station_lists/midas_stations.html). 


 
 We are now working on the problem and hope to restore access to these services as soon as possible. 
We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause. 


 

BADC Support 26/02/02.
