Four members of the CEDA team are attending the European Space Agency’s 2019 [Living Planet Symposium](https://lps19.esa.int/NikalWebsitePortal/living-planet-symposium-2019/lps19) taking place this week in Milan.


This symposium focuses on how Earth Observation contributes to science and society, and how disruptive technologies and actors are changing the traditional Earth Observation landscape, which is also creating new opportunities for public and private sector interactions.
