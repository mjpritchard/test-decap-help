###### The JASMIN2020 conference will showcase how the JASMIN facility is supporting and advancing environmental research. This free event will be held at JASMIN’s home institution, the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) at the Harwell Campus in Oxfordshire, on Tuesday 16th June 2020. The one day event will be an opportunity for users to share experiences of using JASMIN and see how others have solved problems with the available tools/applications. The conference aims to help users get the most out of JASMIN’s facilities by learning from others' experiences. It will also be an opportunity for users to tell the team (and our funders) how using JASMIN for their research has had a positive benefit on the science community and/or wider society. We want the event to be about networking and sharing knowledge so that attendees can go home with ideas for improving their work on JASMIN. The conference will therefore be a mixture of user presentations, updates from the JASMIN team and poster sessions. The JASMIN team will share information about existing (and new) services that are of interest to the community. The conference will be preceded by a hands on training workshop on Monday 15th June covering the topics detailed [here](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/events/working-on-jasmin-a-hands-on-workshop/) (spaces will be limited for this).


**Further details will be announced in the New Year - please save the date in the meantime!**
