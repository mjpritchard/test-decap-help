CEDA is currently planning a range of new events, including workshops and webinars, to complement the regular JASMIN conference. From your feedback, we have realised that you want a range of hands on and interactive training events - so that’s what we have planned! So this year, instead of the conference, we will be running a minimum of three webinars and three workshops. We also aim to have a JASMIN presence at the NCEO and NCAS conferences/staff meetings.


The webinars will cover broader topics like Software on JASMIN, and the JASMIN cloud, whereas the workshops will be focussed on specialist JASMIN services, such as using JULES with ROSE/Cylc. The first webinar is scheduled for 20th March called ‘Further use of Git and GitHub’ - [register now](https://ceda-further-github.eventbrite.co.uk)!


We hope that this will encourage knowledge exchange amongst users and provide more opportunities for you to meet the JASMIN team; rather than just once a year at the JASMIN conference. Our current plan is that the conference will return again in 2020.


We will also continue to run events that have a stronger focus on data and the CEDA archive. All details for these events will be published on the main CEDA website, under the training tab ([here](http://www.ceda.ac.uk/training/webinars/)) and via our social media channels (particularly [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cedanews)). If you have any ideas for topics, then please let us know via the [helpdesk](mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk).
