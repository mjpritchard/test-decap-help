As you may be aware, JASMIN is undergoing a massive upgrade (more info [here](http://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/jasmin-upgrade-reminders-and-further-information/ "JASMIN upgrade news item")) to double it's storage capability to 44PB. This means that there will be some disruption to services on 14th March between 07:00 - 19:00. 


We anticipate all CEDA services to be unavailable or at risk on this day, including the CEDA archive, data catalogue, website, and other related services. 


We apologise for any inconvenience but hope that you understand this necessary work for the continued improvement of JASMIN. 


CEDA team
