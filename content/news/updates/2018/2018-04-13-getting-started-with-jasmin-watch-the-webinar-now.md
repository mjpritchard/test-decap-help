On 21st March, we ran our first ever webinar called ‘Getting started with JASMIN’. The aim of the webinar was to provide a basic overview for new users wanting to learn about what JASMIN is, and how to get access. Over 80 people registered, from a range of institutes and scientific disciplines. The webinar was recorded and is freely available to view [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhF74YhqhjqlRhR2ACSC32eJ4FHzAstoz). We plan to run future webinars approximately every 3 months.


You can either watch the webinar in full, or it is split into shorter sections corresponding to the topics covered as shown below:


* [Full recording](https://youtu.be/aHLMVW2bjdM "Full recording")
* [What can JASMIN be used for?](https://youtu.be/8qpeqOu0i4Q "What can JASMIN be used for?")
* [Setting up your JASMIN account](https://youtu.be/UglV7pJWN3U "Setting up your JASMIN account")
* [Connecting to JASMIN](https://youtu.be/Ln5rq384ldo "Connecting to JASMIN")
* [Group Workspaces (GWS)](https://youtu.be/m0PEHKT2Nvw "Group Workspaces (GWS)")
* [Transferring files](https://youtu.be/B569zA4_kQY "Transferring files")


Unfortunately, some participants struggled with the technology for viewing the live stream. This was likely to have been a browser issue or caused by content blocking by a participants institute or workplace. We are currently reviewing these issues and will aim to offer solutions before the next webinar. This is likely to be in the form of a test video and providing guidelines for watching. Future webinars will continue to be recorded, so if future technical difficulties occur then a recorded option will be available in the following few weeks.   


Providing training for our services is key to our supporting role within the environmental science community. We have three planned webinars as follows:


July = Batch Computing on LOTUS (registration coming soon)


September = Supporting Instrument Scientists


December = Give us your data: how to prepare your research for the CEDA archive


However, if there is another topic that you would be interested in us covering then please let us know via the [CEDA helpdesk](mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk "Contact the CEDA helpdesk"). Further details for future webinars will be published on our social media channels and [training section](http://www.ceda.ac.uk/training/webinars/ "training section") of the CEDA website.
