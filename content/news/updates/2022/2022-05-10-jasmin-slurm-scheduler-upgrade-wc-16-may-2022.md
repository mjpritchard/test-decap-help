Dear users,


Further to our [recent announcement about maintenance periods in May/June 2022](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/jasmin-update-on-forthcoming-maintenance-periods-may-june-2022/), please note the following additional item:


**SLURM Scheduler upgrade, week commencing 16 May 2022**


The LOTUS batch processing cluster will need to be taken down to perform important updates on the SLURM scheduling software on Tuesday 17th May 2022, starting at 08:00. It is anticipated that the work should take no longer than 2 days, but a reservation for the entire week has been made for contingency: if the work completes as planned then it should be possible to remove the reservation before the end of that week.


We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause and for the short notice: please note that jobs with long expected run times will start to be affected by the reservation over the next few days.


JASMIN Team
