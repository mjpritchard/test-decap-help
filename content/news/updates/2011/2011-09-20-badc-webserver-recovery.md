The BADC team are continuing to restore services following an attack on our webserver. However, the following services are not currently operational:


* Trajectory service
* File uploader
* CEDA Visualisation service


We will restore these as soon as possible. Apologies for the disruption this has caused.


Regards,


BADC/NEODC team
