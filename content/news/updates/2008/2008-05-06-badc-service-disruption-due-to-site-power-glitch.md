On Tuesday 6th May, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory site, where the BADC is located, experienced a major network outage. As a result of this, BADC and NEODC services were affected. The network outage was caused by a power glitch which took out a major networking wiring room and then had an avalanche effect across site.


 The problem has now been solved and all BADC services should all be operational again.

As always please let the [BADC Helpdesk](mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk) know if you experience any problems after this time or have any other queries.
