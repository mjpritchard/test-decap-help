The BADC will be sending 7 members of its staff to the Royal Meteorological Society conferences held in Edinburgh from 1st to 6th September 2007. You will be able to find members of staff around the conferences as well as at the BADC trade stand. If you are attending please come along and have a chat with the BADC staff about the services we offer and the science we are involved in. The trade stand will have a number of demonstrations of the type of data sets and services we offer.

The 1st of September will also see the launch of the 2007 BADC Online Users Survey. We will be using this to gauge how well the BADC is serving the atmospheric science research community, so please spend a little bit of time filling this in. More details can be found on the home page throughout the two months that we are running the survey. Once we have collated the results we will post another news item to give you some feedback.


 
You can get to the survey by going to:

And to encourage you to fill in the survey we are running a competition to win a iPAQ hx2490 PDA!
