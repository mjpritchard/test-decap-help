The Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instruments make accurate measurements of the Earth's Radiation Budget. They have been specifically designed to be mounted on a geostationary satellite and are carried onboard the Meteosat Second Generation satellites operated by EUMETSAT. They are produced by a European consortium led by the UK together with Belgium, Italy, and EUMETSAT, with funding from national agencies. 
 
Level 2 ARG Data from the first GERB instrument, onboard MSG-1, is now in the BADC GERB archive and available to academic researchers upon application. This dataset contains the latest version or "Edition" of data released for distribution by the GERB team and extends from March 2004 to May 2007. 
Data from the next GERB instrument, currently operating on MSG-2, is expected to be released in 2008. In all, 4 GERB instruments are planned.
