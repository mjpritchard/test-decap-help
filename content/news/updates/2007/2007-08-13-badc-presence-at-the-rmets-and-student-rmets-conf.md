In September the BADC will have a stand at both the Student and the Main Royal Meteorological Society conferences in Edinburgh. 

Members of BADC staff will not only be on the stand but also attending the various sessions with both poster and oral presentations being given.
We hope that many of our users will take this opportunity to come and have a chat to us about any matters you wish to raise or simply come along and find out more about the range of services the BADC has to offer.
 The conferences will also mark the launch of a 2 month online survey which the BADC will use to ensure that our services are structured to meet your needs. Watch this space for more information in the coming weeks.

 In the meantime if you have any questions please contact us using any of the methods on our [Contact Us](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/contact.html) webpage.
