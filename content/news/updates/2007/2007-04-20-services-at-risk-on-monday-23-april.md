We will be making updates to the BADC website on the morning of Monday 23 April.
Certain services, such as user registration and dataset application will be 
unavailable for a while during this morning. In addition, other services are 
at risk during this time. We aim to minimise any disruption and hope to be fully 
functional again by lunchtime. We appologise for any inconvenience.
