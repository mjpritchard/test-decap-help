Following service interruptions over the weekend one of our system disks is being upgraded and as a result the following datasets
will be unavailable for approximately 24 hours: 
autex-wintex, chablis, eaquate, hadgem1-control, meris, neon, pose, sage2, ukmo-assim, ukmo-surface.


In addition, we will be upgrading our webserver hardware on Thursday 19 July. 

Hopefully this should be transparent
to external users, but there is the possibility of disruption to services. 


The BADC's mailing lists will also be unavailable for some time on July 18 and 19. 

Apologies for any inconvenience.

We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.
