        description: "How to access JASMIN from VSCode",
        
        
        content: "Introduction \u0026nbsp; Visual Studio Code\u0026nbsp; is a richly-featured editor and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which has remote access and other useful features that can be used with JASMIN.\nThis article is in response to requests from users about how use VSCode with JASMIN and is not a product endorsement. Other IDEs with similar features are also available, for example PyCharm\u0026nbsp; .\nThe following demonstrates how to use VSCode to connect to JASMIN, and mentions some of its features for further reading.\nObtaining VSCode \u0026nbsp; Follow the \u0026ldquo;setup\u0026rdquo; link from the page linked above to obtain VSCode for your platform: this should be your local machine, not JASMIN.\n\u0026nbsp; There should be no need for you to install VSCode on JASMIN, and we ask you not to.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t provide it centrally, because the multitude of different extensions and configurations would be too difficult to manage in a multi-user environment, so it makes more sense if you install your own local instance of it, which you can configure as you like: the remote capabilities of VSCode make a central installation unnecessary.\nRead about the following extensions and decide which you think you need (you can always \u0026ldquo;upgrade\u0026rdquo; later)\nRemote-SSH extension\u0026nbsp; enables you connect \u0026amp; remotely edit files Remote Development extension pack\u0026nbsp; this includes the Remote-SSH extension as well as others which enable a raft of other features. You should read about those extensions first, at the links above, but actually install the one you choose by using the Extensions menu within VSCode once you\u0026rsquo;ve installed the application.\nYou will also almost certainly want the following for working with Python locally and on JASMIN.\nPython\u0026nbsp; (includes Pylance and Python Debugger). There are many, many other extensions to add, but you now have the most relevant ones to get you started.\nThese extensions are best installed locally, before connecting to any remote hosts.\nHow to connect? \u0026nbsp; You will need to set up at least one SSH connection profile to a remote host on JASMIN: we\u0026rsquo;ll cover which host(s), shortly.\nVSCode has a tool to help you set this up, and creates entries in your ~/.ssh/config file for the SSH client that you\u0026rsquo;re using.\nFirst consider your SSH client: VSCode will connect using the SSH client of your operating system: there isn\u0026rsquo;t one built into VSCode itself. See presenting your ssh key for details of the \u0026ldquo;agent\u0026rdquo; method: this is more convenient as this is persistent across sessions and you won\u0026rsquo;t be asked for your passphrase on each connection. If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for you, note the extra configuration below which can be added to specify the location of your key instead.\nNext, consider which remote host(s) on JASMIN you want to connect to:\nlogin servers are available from any location, but don\u0026rsquo;t have any software or storage mounted other than your home directory sci servers are probably where you want to work, but aren\u0026rsquo;t directly accessible from outside of the STFC network. xfer servers might be a good choice if it\u0026rsquo;s just editing you\u0026rsquo;re likely to be doing, since they\u0026rsquo;re directly accessible from anywhere and have all filesystems mounted (except scratch). But they\u0026rsquo;re not for doing processing. So the ideal setup might be 2 profiles as follows:\nsci server, accessed via a login server xfer server, accessed directly If we use the tool provided by VSCode to create these, we can customise them further.\nThe following video demonstrates these steps, and the initial setup of 2 connection profiles, on Windows. But the interface is almost identical on Mac and Linux.\nNotes:\nthe sequences have been shortened slightly while installing extensions and initiating the connection. the demo shown assumes the SSH key is already loaded in an ssh-agent. To specify the key location instead, see below. the -A option is only needed IF you will be making onward SSH connections from the remote host \u0026hellip;this can be omitted if not Essential steps \u0026nbsp; Install the extensions Create a connection profile start by entering the one-liner command you would use to connect to a sci server via a login server, i.e. ssh -A username@sci-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk -J username@login-01.jasmin.ac.uk this creates an entry in ~/.ssh/config (it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to choose that location) This entry can be customised, by editing that file note that the Host is a \u0026ldquo;friendly name\u0026rdquo; which you can define, whereas HostName is the actual full name of the host including domain, e.g. sci-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk Add other entries as needed in this case, we added a second profile for xfer-vm-01 which, being an xfer server, is directly accessible so does not need the ProxyJump Save the file ~/.ssh/config and restart VSCode The new profiles are available next time you open it Connect to one of the remote hosts you just made Open a terminal on that host \u0026hellip;and now you\u0026rsquo;re able to work on JASMIN Specifying the key location \u0026nbsp; Alternative method if you can\u0026rsquo;t get the \u0026ldquo;agent\u0026rdquo; method to work (but means that you may be prompted for the key passphrase each time you connect):\nedit ~/.ssh/config and add the line with IdentityFile as shown: Host sci-vm-01-via-login-01 Hostname sci-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk User username ProxyJump username@login-01.jasmin.ac.uk ForwardAgent yes IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin Further tips \u0026nbsp; Editing large files may be slow compared to editing them in place on the remote server. If you\u0026rsquo;re using VSCode locally without the remote host connection described above, you can still open a Terminal to use SSH commands to connect to remote hosts, but this will be without the integration that the full remote host connection provides (e.g. won\u0026rsquo;t display your remote directories and files in the explorer bar). There\u0026rsquo;s a lot more that you can do with VSCode locally (even without the remote connection that this article describes). For example:\nsyntax colouring and code auto-completion for a huge range of languages Git integration\u0026nbsp; , note you need git installed locally(see git\u0026nbsp; for Windows) Working with Jupyter notebooks\u0026nbsp; locally in VSCode and many other features beyond the scope of this article.\nThis makes an IDE such as VSCode a good choice to install locally, rather than using the (fairly basic) editors available on JASMIN.\nTroubleshooting \u0026nbsp; Permission denied \u0026nbsp; If you get permission denied when connecting, you should troubleshoot this as you would any other SSH connection.\nOpen a terminal within VSCode and check that your SSH key is being presented correctly. If it\u0026rsquo;s not listed when you do\nssh-add -l then:\ngo back to presenting your ssh key and check your setup alternatively, specify the location of your key as detailed above Can\u0026rsquo;t connect to a remote host that previously worked \u0026nbsp; VSCode starts a small server process on the remote host when you connect. Occasionally this can get stuck. One method of fixing this is to:\nquit VSCode from a separate SSH client terminal, log in to the same host identify any .vscode-server process running on that host, e.g. ps -ef | grep $USER | grep vscode note the process ID (PID) number (1st numerical column) and kill that process kill \u0026lt;PID\u0026gt; recursively delete the ~/.vscode-server directory which VSCode created in your JASMIN home directory rm -rf ~/.vscode-server Retry connecting to the remote host If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, try rebooting your own machine, then repeating the above steps."

        content: "IMPORTANT: Please see also Understanding new JASMIN storage which explains more about the different types of storage as of Phase 4 of JASMIN\u0026rsquo;s history.\nHome directory \u0026nbsp; Every JASMIN user is allocated a HOME directory located at /home/users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;. This directory is available across most of the interactive and batch computing resources, including the JASMIN login and transfer servers.\nIn the commands on this page, please replace \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; with your username, or use the environment variable $USER. For example, /home/users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt; becomes /home/users/joebloggs. Each home directory has a default quota of 100 GB. Although you can\u0026rsquo;t directly check usage against your quota, you can find out the current size of your home directory as follows (the pdu command is a parallel variant of the du command, designed to work with the particular storage used for home directories on JASMIN).\npdu -sh /home/users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt; # ^^^^^^^^^^ replace with your username \u0026nbsp; You are only allowed to exceed the 100 GB quota for a very brief period of time. If you continue to exceed the limit, you will be unable to add any more files, which means that jobs may fail, and other things may stop working for you. You will need to reduce your usage below the 100GB quota to resolve this. Backups of your home directory \u0026nbsp; Your home directory is backed up using a daily snapshot which provides a quick, self-service method for you to restore files or directories that have been accidentally deleted. Snapshot backups are kept for 1-2 weeks before being deleted.\nRecovering snapshots of your home directory data \u0026nbsp; Users can access snapshots to recover files/directories that have been accidentally deleted. These are stored in /home/users/.snapshot/homeusers.\u0026lt;snapshotid\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\nThe most recent backup is the one with the highest snapshot id number.\nFind the ones relevant to your username with a command line this:\nls -ld /home/users/.snapshot/homeusers2.*/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt; # replace \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; with your own, as before There should be up to 14 directories like this:\ndrwx------ 113 joeblogs users 0 Jan 26 15:00 /home/users/.snapshot/homeusers2.2024_01_28_02_01/joebloggs drwx------ 113 joeblogs users 0 Jan 26 15:00 /home/users/.snapshot/homeusers2.2024_01_29_02_01/joebloggs drwx------ 113 joeblogs users 0 Jan 29 09:51 /home/users/.snapshot/homeusers2.2024_01_30_02_01/joebloggs drwx------ 113 joeblogs users 0 Jan 30 09:29 /home/users/.snapshot/homeusers2.2024_01_31_02_01/joebloggs drwx------ 113 joeblogs users 0 Jan 30 09:29 /home/users/.snapshot/homeusers2.2024_02_01_02_01/joebloggsEach of these snapshot directories effectively contains your home directory as it was on that date.

These can be retrieved in a similar manner to that shown above. In this case the relevant directories should be found at\n/gws/smf/jNN/\u0026lt;gwsname\u0026gt;/.snapshot (where NN = 04 or 07 depending on where the volume is located)\n\u0026nbsp; All other group workspace volumes are not backed up. The only exception to this is the snapshot backups for smf SSD volumes just described. Please also note the advice on inter-volume symlinks, below: these are to be avoided.\nJASMIN disk mounts \u0026nbsp; There is a common file system layout that underpins most of the JASMIN infrastructure.

Please follow these general principles when deciding where to write your data:\nHOME directories (/home/users) are relatively small (100GB) and should NOT be used for storing large data volumes or for sharing data with other users. 0 Group Workspaces (mostly /gws/nopw/*/\u0026lt;project\u0026gt; but some /gws/pw/*/\u0026lt;project) are usually the correct place to write your data, although they are not backed up. Please refer to the Group Workspace documentation for details. /gws/pw/j07 volumes are parallel-write-capable storage from Phase 7 (onwards) of JASMIN /gws/nopw/j04 volumes are \u0026ldquo;Scale out Filesystem\u0026rdquo; (SOF) from Phase 4 (onwaards) of JASMIN: this storage is not parallel-write-capable The \u0026ldquo;scratch\u0026rdquo; areas (/work/scratch-pw2, /work/scratch-pw3 and /work/scratch-nopw) are available as a temporary file space for jobs running on LOTUS (see next section below). The /tmp directory is not usually an appropriate location to write your data (see next section below). How to use the temporary disk space \u0026nbsp; Scratch \u0026nbsp; The scratch areas /work/scratch-pw2, /work/scratch-pw3 and /work/scratch-nopw are a temporary file space shared across the entire LOTUS cluster and the scientific analysis servers.\nThese scratch areas are ideal for processes that generate intermediate data files that are consumed by other parts of the processing before being deleted. Please remember that these volumes are resources shared between all users, so consider other users and remember to clean up after your jobs. **** Any data that you wish to keep should be written to a Group Workspace (but remember to change the group-ownership of the data if you do).\nThere are 2 types of scratch storage available:\nPFS scratch (lots of it, fast, less good for small files) as 2 x 1 PB volumes /work/scratch-pw[2,3] and particularly suitable for users with a need for storage capabale of shared-file writes with MPI-IO, but good for most purposes. SSD scratch (less of it, very fast, good for small files) /work/scratch-nopw2 as 1 x 220 TB volume. Do not use for operations that attempt to write to multiple parts of a file simultaneously. Please be aware of this if your code (perhaps inadvertently?) writes to a shared log file. When using the \u0026ldquo;scratch\u0026rdquo; areas, please create a sub-directory (e.g. /work/scratch-????/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;) labelled with your username and write your data there.\n/tmp \u0026nbsp; In contrast to the \u0026ldquo;scratch\u0026rdquo; space, /tmp directories on LOTUS nodes and physical sci machines are all local to the machine. These can be used to store small volumes of temporary data for a job that only needs to be read by the local process. But /tmp on virtual sci machines, are not local and therefore should not usually be used by users.\nCleaning up the scratch and tmp directories \u0026nbsp; Please make sure that your jobs delete any files under the /tmpand scratch directories when they are complete ( especially if jobs have not been completed normally!).\nPlease do this yourself so that you are not taken by surprise when automated deletion processes clear up any residual data:\n\u0026nbsp; Automated cleanup processes run daily and delete files that are older than 28 days from the last time of being accessed. This applies to /work/scratch-pw2, /work/scratch-pw3 and /work/scratch-nopw2\nPlease remember that shared temporary storage is for the use of all 2,000 users of JASMIN, not just you. If you persistently store large amounts (100s of TB) of data in scratch for long periods of tine, you deny use of that storage to other users (so expect action from the JASMIN team).\nPlease be a good JASMIN citizen!\nAny important data for keeping should be written to a Group Workspace or to your home directory if appropriate.**\nThe /work/scratch-pw[2,3] and /work/scratch-nopw areas are not available on the xfer, login or nx-login servers.\nAvoid inadvertently writing to /tmp \u0026nbsp; Sometimes software is configured by default to write to /tmp. Where possible, you should over-ride this and use your group workspace or a username-labelled directory within the scratch space instead.\nTo do this, please add the following lines (or similar) to your $HOME/.bashrc file:\nexport TMPDIR=/\u0026lt;path-to-your-GWS-or-scratch\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;your_username\u0026gt;/tmp # create the directory if needed [ -d $TMPDIR ] || mkdir -p $TMPDIR\u0026hellip;but please check that location regularly to clear it out!\nAccess to the CEDA archive \u0026nbsp; The CEDA Archive is mounted read-only under paths refleting the NERC data centres which merged to form CEDA, i.e.\n/badc (British Atmospheric Data Centre) /neodc (NERC Earth Observation Data Centre). (other data centre paths now also exist at that level: see CEDA Help docs\u0026nbsp; for more info)\nThe Archive includes a range of data sets that are provided under varying licences. Access to these groups is managed through standard Unix groups. Information about the data and their access restrictions is available from the CEDA Catalogue\u0026nbsp; .\n\u0026nbsp; As a JASMIN user, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the correct permissions to access data any data in CEDA Archive from within JASMIN, even if file system permissions permit access. Tape access \u0026nbsp; Group workspace managers also have access to near-line storage on tape, see Elastic Tape service for making secondary copies and managing storage between online and near-line storage.\nNumber of files in a single directory \u0026nbsp; It is highly recommended that you do not exceed more than 100,000 files in a single directory on any type of storage on JASMIN. Large numbers of files place unnecessary load on components of the file system and can be the source of slow performance for you and other storage volumes in the system. To count the number of files, please note the advice in slow ls response below, or use an alternative command e.g. find.\nSlow \u0026rsquo;ls\u0026rsquo; response \u0026nbsp; This can be due to a number of reasons (see above advice regarding number of files in a single directory, and below regarding inter-volume symlinks). To speed up the response (useful if you want to count the number of files) it often helps to un-alias ls, e.g. by placing a backslash in front of the command: \\ls.\nAdvice on inter-volume symlinks in JASMIN storage \u0026nbsp; We highly recommend users not to use symbolic links in their home directories to other parts of the JASMIN file systems, such as GWSs or scratch areas. There are a number of conditions when the petabyte-scale JASMIN storage can become unusable for all users due to these links. There is a more technical explanation below. We would advise path substitutions using environment variables instead.\nSymlinks in users\u0026rsquo; home directories that point to other volumes (for example group workspaces) make matters worse when there are problems on the sci*.jasmin.ac.uk servers and other shared machines, and/or when the metadata servers responsible for particular storage volumes themselves become overloaded. The simplest advice we can currently give is to avoid using symlinks.\nIn more detail:\nThis issue is particularly apparent when ls is aliassed to ls --color (as is the default on 99% of JASMIN systems) AND one of the colorisation options specified is for an orphaned link. The ls on symlinks causes the metadata servers at the end of the symlink to be called (to provided the stat filesystem metadata), in addition to the metadata server for the home directory. If those metadata servers at the far end are under load, or have some other problem, the ls to the home directory can hang, but this also hangs other users who may be trying to ls their own home directory (even if theirs contains no symlinks). The situation can then escalate out of control as more and more users try and fail.\nThis is happens especially where one or more of the volumes involved contains large numbers of small files."

        description: "Data transfer tool bbcp",
        
        
        content: "This article provides information about the bbcp data transfer tool.\nWhat is bbcp? \u0026nbsp; bbcp\u0026nbsp; is a simple command-line tool which can use your SSH connection to transfer data in and out of JASMIN efficiently. It works in a similar way to GridFTP over SSH in that it connects to the transfer server using your usual SSH credentials but then can set up parallel data streams for transferring data. One advantage of bbcp that it is provided as a single binary executable which is easy to download and use.\nUsing bbcp on JASMIN \u0026nbsp; Check with your local administrator to see if it is installed centrally on your own system. If it isn\u0026rsquo;t, you may need to download the correct binary from the bbcp download site\u0026nbsp; and simply place it in your path on your local filesystem: this can be done as a regular/unprivileged user. At the JASMIN end, you can put the same executable in your home directory (somewhere in your $PATH e.g. in your ~/bin directory, and make sure you give the file execute permission). Once you have the bbcp command you can access any file which is readable by you when logged into JASMIN, or write to a Group Workspace that you have access to.\nConfiguring bbcp for JASMIN \u0026nbsp; When contacting hpxfer[34].jasmin.ac.uk you will need to set a couple of important options for it to work. The exact options depend on whether you are moving data into or out of JASMIN, and from where the transfer is initiated.\nThe bbcp protocol, in common with most high-bandwidth transfer tools, requires a set of ports to be open at one or both ends in order to establish data connections. Due to firewall restrictions this range of ports needs to be agreed in advance. In the case of hpxfer[34].jasmin.ac.uk the range of ports is 50000:51000. Therefore all bbcp commands must contain the option --port 50000:51000.\nAlso, hpxfer[34] will only allow incoming connections on these ports, therefore hpxfer[34] must be the server which listens for data connections. By default bbcp will listen for data connections at the end receiving data and connect from the end sending data. Therefore, with the default options, bbcp will succeed when pushing data to hpxfer[34] but fail when pulling data from it. In order to pull data, with the transfer initiated on the remote server, you must include the -z flag. Therefore the recommended commands for transferring in either direction are:\nInitiate on JASMIN: Pull Data from remote server \u0026nbsp; bbcp -v -4 -P 5 -F --port 50000:51000 username@remote-server:\u0026lt;PATH-TO-SOURCE-FILE\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PATH-TO-TARGET-FILE\u0026gt; Initiate on JASMIN: Push Data \u0026nbsp; bbcp -v -4 -P 5 --port 50000:51000 \u0026lt;PATH-TO-SOURCE-FILE\u0026gt; username@remote-server:\u0026lt;PATH-TO-TARGET-FILE\u0026gt; Initiate on remote server: Pull Data from JASMIN \u0026nbsp; bbcp -v -z -4 -P 5 --port 50000:51000 username@hpxfer3.jasmin.ac.uk:\u0026lt;PATH-TO-SOURCE-FILE\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PATH-TO-TARGET-FILE\u0026gt; Initiate on remote server: Push Data to JASMIN \u0026nbsp; bbcp -v -4 -P 5 -F --port 50000:51000 \u0026lt;PATH-TO-SOURCE-FILE\u0026gt; username@hpxfer3.jasmin.ac.uk:\u0026lt;PATH-TO-TARGET-FILE\u0026gt; In this case the -v flag produces verbose output .-V can be used for even more verbose output. The -4 option forces use of IP version 4 instead of IPv6 (essential for transfers to and from hpxfer3 or other JASMIN hosts. Note: this option may not be available in some older versions of bbcp), and the -P option reports the status of the transfer every n seconds. The default behaviour will print nothing. The -F option skips a check on the target host to check if there is enough disk space. This overcomes occasional problems where free space is not correctly reported to bbcp by the JASMIN file system.\nFor the full set of options, see: https://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/\u0026nbsp; Note: the bbcp command must be in your $PATH on both the source and target machine.\nInitiate on JASMIN: Pull Data from remote server, specifying SSH command to start bbcp \u0026nbsp; bbcp -v -4 -P 5 -F --port 50000:51000 -S \u0026#34;/usr/bin/ssh %I -l %U %H /path/to/bbcp\u0026#34; username@remote-server:\u0026lt;PATH-TO-SOURCE-FILE\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PATH-TO-TARGET-FILE\u0026gt; The path /path/to/bbcp can be replaced by module load bbcp; bbcp (or whatever is the appropriate local requirement) in environments where bbcp is a module which needs to be loaded first.\nbbcp -v -4 -P 5 -F --port 50000:51000 -S \u0026#34;/usr/bin/ssh %I -l %U %H module load bbcp; bbcp\u0026#34; username@remote-server:\u0026lt;PATH-TO-SOURCE-FILE\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PATH-TO-TARGET-FILE\u0026gt; For specifying the SSH command to start bbcp on the TARGET node, use the -T option.\nThe bbcp site\u0026nbsp; has good documentation on further options, including the -r option for recursive transfers. A number of useful tutorials are also available elsewhere on the web.\nTuning Recommendations \u0026nbsp; We recommend you tune your connection by trying various different options on a few GBs of data.\nBy default 4 streams are opened. Try 1 stream first, particularly on fast connections, it may be faster. This is achieved with the option -s 1. We ask users of JASMIN to tune up to a maximum of 16 streams (-s 16). Do not tune the window size unless you continue to get very poor bandwidth after adjusting the number of streams. Most modern operating systems will auto-tune this parameter. bbcp is not ideal for large directory trees of small files. If you have thousands of small files you may be better off with rsync or possibly GridFTP/Globus, depending on the network. Another simpler option is tarring/zipping the data first before transferring. Troubleshooting \u0026nbsp; bbcp uses SSH to establish the control connection so you need to set up your SSH key in the same way as you would to SSH into hpxfer[12].jasmin.ac.uk. If bbcp isn\u0026rsquo;t working you should first check you can SSH to hpxfer[34].jasmin.ac.uk. If you can\u0026rsquo;t, please review the steps in the Getting Started section before contacting the JASMIN Helpdesk. Make that you have logged in (via SSH) to both the JASMIN transfer server and the remote server with the -A option (agent-forwarding enabled), to ensure that your credentials are used by SSH as it invokes bbcp on the other server. Try adding the -Foption to disable bbcp\u0026rsquo;s filesystem checking if you get the following error: bbcp: Insufficient space to copy all the files from \u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;. If you see the following error message: Address family not supported by protocol creating inet socketthis is most likely because the -4 flag was not specified. This may happen with commands that once worked, as a previously installed version of bbcp on JASMIN defaulted to IPv4. Currently there is no support for IPv6 on JASMIN. If the version of bbcp you have available on your system is old and does not have the -4 option, consider downloading the appropriate (newer) version from the link above. It is also possible to compile the executable from source."

The default CentOS public catalog template is configured to use DNS, NTP and yum repo network services from the internet, not from the RAL site. SMTP (mail) server/relay configuration is the responsibility/choice of the tenant. We recommend tenants choose a hosted email server with virus and SPAM filtering and not attempt to configure their own email pipelines. Reverse DNS (IP to hostname) for 192.171.129.0/25 is managed by NERC DNS servers along with ( shortly ) default forward A name records.

        content: "Overview \u0026nbsp; The CEDA Archive\u0026nbsp; provides direct access to thousands of atmospheric, climate change and earth observation datasets. The Archive is directly accessible as a file system from the shared science machines on JASMIN.\nIt is a separate service run by the CEDA team - it is not a JASMIN service. Therefore, many of the links in this document will take you to the CEDA Archive help documentation site\u0026nbsp; (as the information relates to CEDA Archive services). This is separate from the JASMIN help documentation site (which is specifically about JASMIN services).\nRegister for a CEDA Account \u0026nbsp; First, you need a CEDA Archive account. If you do not have a CEDA account, please follow the steps in this CEDA help document\u0026nbsp; to register as a new CEDA user. It also explains how you can reset your password if you have forgotten it. When you have made a CEDA account, you will then need to use the CEDA portal to link it to your JASMIN account\u0026nbsp; .\nThe JASMIN Account Portal deals with the management of access to JASMIN resources (e.g. compute and storage), whereas MyCEDA\u0026nbsp; (the CEDA Accounts Portal) deals with access to CEDA resources (e.g. access to datasets in the archives). You will need both accounts linked in order to access CEDA Archive data from JASMIN - you can check whether your accounts are linked from within the CEDA Accounts Portal\u0026nbsp; .\nAccessing the CEDA Archive on JASMIN servers \u0026nbsp; Once you have linked your CEDA and JASMIN accounts, you will have access to large parts of the archive straightaway.\nThe contents of the CEDA Archive are available on the file system under /badc and /neodc. Note: do not access data via any symlinks that point to /datacentre/archvol* - these are not permanent links and may change when data are migrated to new storage. Please use the archive path names under /badc and /neodc. Search the CEDA data catalogue\u0026nbsp; for further details about data held in the archive.\nNote: /badc is for atmospheric \u0026amp; climate model data, /neodc is for earth observation data - they are named after CEDA\u0026rsquo;s previous archive names (British Atmospheric Data Centre, and the NERC Earth Observation Data Centre).\nMost data on the Archive is open access - however, some datasets are restricted. You can work this out by looking at the UNIX access groups the data are within (see below). If your required datasets are restricted, access to these can be obtained by applying for specific access via the data centre (see this article\u0026nbsp; for more details). If direct access is not possible the data can be obtained via standard web-based\u0026nbsp; access methods to the CEDA Archive and transferred to a suitable group workspace on JASMIN. As the data centres use the same JASMIN infrastructure the transfer rates are high.\nThe CEDA Data Catalogue\u0026nbsp; is a useful tool to find and apply for access to datasets.\nArchive access groups \u0026nbsp; The UNIX access groups used within the CEDA Archive are listed below with links to example datasets in the CEDA data catalogue for those wishing to use them:\nopen - Available to any logged in JASMIN user with a linked CEDA user account. See a full list of available datasets here\u0026nbsp; . cmip5_research - Restricted CMIP3\u0026nbsp; and CMIP5\u0026nbsp; datasets esacat1 - Satellite data including MERIS\u0026nbsp; , MIPAS\u0026nbsp; and SCIAMACHY\u0026nbsp; . ecmwf - Access to the ECMWF Operational Datasets\u0026nbsp; . eurosat - Satellite data including IASI\u0026nbsp; , AVHRR-3\u0026nbsp; and GOME-2\u0026nbsp; . ukmo_wx - Met Office observational dataset collections including LIDARNET\u0026nbsp; , MIDAS\u0026nbsp; , MetDB\u0026nbsp; and NIMROD\u0026nbsp; ukmo_clim - Climatology datasets from the Met Office, including Central England Temperature\u0026nbsp; dataset collection, HadISST\u0026nbsp; . byacl - These data have specific restrictions on them meaning that they can\u0026rsquo;t be accessed directly from JASMIN, but can be obtained via web access\u0026nbsp; . Data Licensing \u0026nbsp; All use of data accessed directly from the CEDA Archive must be used in line with the relevant data licence in place for the relevant dataset for the purposes stated in the access application. Data licence information can be found on the relevant CEDA Data Catalogue page, a link to which can be found in the 00README_catalogue_and_licence.txt files found in the archive. For specific data licences granted for restricted datasets, users should log into their MyCEDA page to view their granted licence and the associated usage purpose under which access was granted. Any required alternative use of the data beyond the original purpose stated in the original licence application can only be made with a freshly granted new licence application.\nAccessing data in the archive \u0026nbsp; In the example below, the logged-in user is listing the contents of the CRU data sets within the BADC archive. These are \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; so all logged-in users can access them:\nls -l /badc/cru/data total 320 -rw-r----- 1 badc open 396 Feb 18 2015 00README drwxr-x--- 8 badc open 4096 Mar 22 10:32 cru_cy drwxr-x--- 4 badc open 4096 Dec 6 2014 crutem drwxr-x--- 12 badc open 4096 May 9 14:11 cru_ts drwxr-x--- 3 badc open 4096 Feb 18 2015 PDSI The CEDA Archive Data Browser\u0026nbsp; is a good place to start as it gives a web-based view of the data with additional metadata but enables copying \u0026amp; pasting the directory path for use within the JASMIN environment:\nceda archive data browser"

        content: "\u0026nbsp; DEPRECATED: This article will shortly become obsolete following JASMIN\u0026rsquo;s migration to the Rocky 9 operating system. The previous restriction on network domains and reverse DNS does not apply to the set of new machines (and old ones are being replaced). This article explains how to:\ncheck that your network domain is able to access JASMIN resources check that the particular host from which you are intending to connect to JASMIN has the required network configuration Check network domain (non .ac.uk users) \u0026nbsp; In order to maintain a secure and reliable scientific infrastructure for its users, JASMIN restricts login access by maintaining an \u0026ldquo;allow list\u0026rdquo; of network domains that are allowed to make SSH connections to the JASMIN login gateways and data transfer servers.\nAll .ac.uk network domains (i.e. UK universities and \u0026ldquo;academic\u0026rdquo; institutions) are already registered.\nIf your institution\u0026rsquo;s network domain is not .ac.uk, please request for it to be added to the allow list by contacting the JASMIN Helpdesk, after reading the information in the following section about forward and reverse DNS lookup.\nCheck IP address resolves to network domain (all users) \u0026nbsp; In addition to being on the allowed IP list there is an additional requirement that the address of your local computer must have forward and reverse DNS lookup enabled. This means that the hostname must resolve to an IP address, and the IP address must resolve to the fully-qualified hostname.\nOne easy way to do this is to access the following URL from the machine which will be used to make the SSH connection to JASMIN :\nhttps://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/services/reverse_dns_check/\u0026nbsp; If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a web browser on that machine, you can use the \u0026lsquo;curl\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;wget\u0026rsquo; Linux commands to make an HTTP request to that URL, and inspect the output. A successful response will look like this:\nExternal IP address: 130.246.123.456 Resolved to host: vpn-3-167.rl.ac.ukWhereas an unsuccessful response will look like this:\nExternal IP address: 130.246.123.456 Reverse DNS lookup failedIf your IP address does not resolve, please contact your local IT technical support desk and show them this article to help explain the context.\nIt is important that the network domain to which the IP address resolves is part of the network domain which has been allowed. If there is no obvious relationship between the network domain of the host and that of your institution (derived from your email address), you may be asked to provide additional justification or your connection may be denied. Some institutions prefer not to provide public DNS listings: in this case please ask the technical support representative to contact the JASMIN helpdesk on your behalf to see if a technical solution can be found.\nThis can be a problem if you attempt to connect directly from a commercial home or business internet service provider. Wherever possible, please connect to your institution (which is likely to be on the allow list already) before making an outgoing SSH connection to a JASMIN server.\nAs long as the IP address resolves to a fully-qualified hostname within the allowed domain, it does not matter whether the host has a static or dynamically-assigned (DHCP) IP address.\nIf you cannot obtain an IP address that resolves in this way, you may still be able to access (only) login2.jasmin.ac.uk, which has been configured to enable access without the reverse DNS restriction. However, this is likely to be the only entry point available to you and will limit what you can do on JASMIN. Doing so can be useful as a temporary solution, but to gain full use of JASMIN you will need to have an IP address that resolves to the domain of your institution. For access to graphical desktops, equivalent servers nx- login2.jasmin.ac.uk and nx-login3.jasmin.ac.uk have been provided and for transfer tasks, an additional transfer server xfer3.jasmin.ac.uk is available. See login servers and transfer servers, but note the additional access role required in the case of the transfer server."

Clusters can be customised, for example to add new packages. But be careful not to break the configuration of the clustering software! Note: If a tenants makes a change which breaks the cluster patching, the cluster will have to be rebuilt. Patching \u0026nbsp; Users are responsible for applying patches. However, patching a cluster is a simple task triggered in the JASMIN Cloud Portal. Cluster admins to decide when to trigger a patch. Access to CEDA archive and JASMIN Group Workspaces \u0026nbsp; No POSIX access to the CEDA archive or JASMIN Group Workspaces. Read-only access via HTTP/OPeNDAP is possible. Read-write access to the JASMIN Object Store is also possible. The CaaS system has cluster types that provide shared storage between clusters. User management \u0026nbsp; Tenancies must manage their own users/groups. Users of services in a tenancy do not need a JASMIN account. However a JASMIN account is required to use the JASMIN Cloud Portal. Encourages a structure where admins provision and maintain clusters on behalf of their users. The CaaS system has an Identity Manager which provides identity services for a tenancy, i.e. users have a single identity across all clusters within in a single tenancy. However this identity is not linked to a JASMIN account. Available cluster types \u0026nbsp; Cluster type Details Identity Manager Manages identity and permissions for other clusters using a combination of FreeIPA\u0026nbsp; and Keycloak\u0026nbsp; .

Creating a cluster \u0026nbsp; Clusters are created via the JASMIN Cloud Portal using a new Clusters tab alongside Overview , Machines , and Volumes. If you do not see this tab, then clusters are not enabled for your tenancy.\nSelect clusters tab if available Click on the tab and you will see a list of your existing clusters. To create a new cluster, click on the New cluster button - this will launch a dialogue where you can select a cluster type:\nSelect a cluster type Clicking on a cluster type will show a form collecting parameters for the cluster, which will be different for each cluster type (the options for each cluster type are discussed in more detail in other articles):\nSpecify parameters for new cluster Click Create cluster to start the cluster creation. The cluster may take several minutes to configure (especially as the initial configuration includes a full patch of operating system packages):\nCreate the cluster Once configuration is complete, the cluster status will become READY. The cluster is then ready to use:\nCluster in READY status More details of how to use each cluster type are given in other help articles on this site, linked in the table of available cluster types above.\nVisit the Machines tab to see the machines that were created as part of the cluster:\nList machines created as part of the cluster Updating a cluster \u0026nbsp; Some cluster options, such the number of workers in a Kubernetes cluster, can be updated after a cluster has been created.

        content: "This article describes how to deploy and use the JASMIN Cluster-as-a-Service (CaaS) Identity Manager.\nIntroduction \u0026nbsp; The Identity Manager consists of a FreeIPA\u0026nbsp; server, a Keycloak\u0026nbsp; server and a gateway/proxy server that work together to provide a single identity across all cluster types, whether via a web-browser, SSH or custom CLI tools like kubectl.\nFreeIPA\u0026nbsp; is an open-source identity management system specifically designed to manage Linux hosts and the user accounts on those hosts. To do this, It integrates LDAP\u0026nbsp; , Kerberos\u0026nbsp; , NTP\u0026nbsp; , DNS\u0026nbsp; and a certificate authority\u0026nbsp; into a single unit that is easy to install and configure.\nKeycloak\u0026nbsp; is an open-source product that provides single sign-on (SSO) using OpenID Connect\u0026nbsp; and SAML\u0026nbsp; , primarily aimed at web-based services.\nFreeIPA and Keycloak are powerful systems, and a full discussion of their capabilities is beyond the scope of this article. This article focuses on their use within the CaaS system, and will be sufficient for the vast majority of users. Any usage that deviates from that described in the JASMIN CaaS documentation is not explicitly supported, should something go wrong.\nAll hosts deployed using CaaS are registered with the FreeIPA instance for your tenancy, and FreeIPA provides DNS, user/group management and access control policies for those hosts. FreeIPA is also the single source of truth for users and groups on your clusters. It is not possible to link with other accounts, including JASMIN accounts. Keycloak is used to provide OpenID Connect support for web applications, and for Kubernetes authentication. Although Keycloak can manage its own users and groups, in the Identity Manager setup it consumes the users and groups from FreeIPA via the LDAP integration in order to provide a single user account across all clusters.\nThe web interfaces for FreeIPA and Keycloak are exposed through a single gateway/proxy host. This host is also configured to allow SSH access for all active users, which means it can be used with SSH agent forwarding\u0026nbsp; as a jump host\u0026nbsp; for SSH access to clusters without an external IP (similar to the way that the MISSING LINK work.)\nThe Identity Manager does not have self-service user registration or password reset - these operations must be performed by an admin on behalf of the user.\nCluster configuration \u0026nbsp; The following variables are available when creating an Identity Manager:\nVariable Description Required? Can be updated? External IP The external IP that will be attached to the gateway host. This is the the IP that can be used as a jump host for SSH access. Yes No Admin password The password for the admin account. When the Identity Manager is created, this is the only user that exists. Please make sure you choose a secure password. WARNING: This password cannot be changed. Changing the admin password in the FreeIPA web interface will break cluster configuration for all clusters. Yes No Admin IP ranges One or more IP ranges from which admins will access the FreeIPA and Keycloak web interfaces, in CIDR notation\u0026nbsp; . Any attempt to access the admin interfaces froman IP address that is not in these ranges will be blocked. FreeIPA and Keycloak allow the creation and modification of users and permissions for all your clusters, so it is recommended that this range be as small as possible. If you are not sure what value to use here, contact your local network administrator to find out the appropriate value for your network. Yes Yes FreeIPA size The machine size to use for the FreeIPA server. Yes No Keycloak size The machine size to use for the Keycloak server. Yes No Gateway size The machine size to use for the gateway server. Yes No Gateway domain The domain to use for the gateway server.\nIf left empty, \u0026lt;dashed-gateway-ip\u0026gt;.sslip.io is used (this uses the sslip.io\u0026nbsp; service). For example, if the selected gateway IP is 192.171.139.83, the domain will be 192-171-139-83.sslip.io.\nIf given, the domain must already be configured to point to the External IP , otherwise configuration will fail. Only use this option if you have control over your own DNS entries - the CaaS system will not create a DNS entry for you. No No Once configuration is complete, the FreeIPA web interface will be available at https://\u0026lt;gateway domain\u0026gt;. You should be able to authenticate with the username admin and the password that was given at deployment time:\nFreeIPA web interface The Keycloak web interface is available at https://\u0026lt;gateway domain\u0026gt;/auth/. You should be able to authenticate with the same username and password as FreeIPA.\nKeycloak web interface Managing users \u0026nbsp; The users of your clusters are not related in any way to JASMIN users - in fact, there is no requirement that the users of your clusters have a JASMIN account. The pattern we encourage is that one or more admins with JASMIN accounts and access to the JASMIN Cloud Portal deploy and maintain clusters on behalf of their users. Those admins can then create user accounts and grant access to clusters for their own users without those users even needing to be aware of JASMIN.\nCreating a user \u0026nbsp; To add a new user, first log in to the FreeIPA interface. Do not add users via the Keycloak interface. You will be taken to the users panel, where you click the Add button:\nFreeIPA interface: adding a new user This will pop up a dialogue for you to populate some basic information about the user. The User login , First name , Last name and New/Verify password fields are the ones that need to be populated. Pick a strong password for the user - they can change this later via the FreeIPA interface if they wish:\nUser information dialogue Click Add to create the user. You must then securely distribute this password to the user - if possible, write it down and give it to them in person, otherwise use an encrypted email.\nThe first time they log in, they will be asked to set a new password. Make sure they do this as soon as possible:\nUpdate password dialogue The newly added user cannot do anything except view the users and modify some of their own information. They can see, but not edit, their group memberships.\nView of user info Adding an SSH public key \u0026nbsp; Adding an SSH public key can be done either by the user themselves or by an admin. First, navigate to the details page for the user. In the Account Settings section, there is an item called SSH public keys. Click the Add button next to it:\nAdding an SSH key (1) This will open a dialogue where the SSH public key can be entered:\nAdding an SSH key (2) After clicking Set , the user interface will show New: key set under the SSH public keys item. However, the key is not preserved until the user is saved by clicking the Save button:\nAdding an SSH key (3) Once saved, the content of the SSH public keys item will change to a fingerprint, which means the key was saved correctly. The key can be updated or deleted at any point in the future if the associated private key is compromised or lost:\nAdding an SSH key (4) Changing a user\u0026rsquo;s password \u0026nbsp; FreeIPA has no facility for self-service password reset, however users can change their own password or an admin can reset it on their behalf. The procedure is the same in both cases, except that when changing their own password the user is required to provide their current password as well as the new one.\nTo change a user\u0026rsquo;s password, first navigate to the user details page then select Reset password from the Actions dropdown:\nReset password (1)) This will open a dialogue where a new password can be entered. An admin changing the password on behalf of another user will only see the New/Verify Password fields:\nReset password (2) A user resetting their own password will also see Current Password and OTP fields. The current password must be provided. OTP can be ignored.\nUser resetting own password After clicking Reset Password , the password is changed.\nIf a user\u0026rsquo;s password is reset by an admin, the user will be asked to change their password the first time they log in, like when a new user is created.\nDeleting a user \u0026nbsp; To delete a user, navigate to the Identity \u0026gt; Users \u0026gt; Active users page. On this page, check the box next the user you want to disable, then click the Delete button:\nDeleting a user (1) In the confirmation dialogue that pops up, make sure to select preserve as the Delete mode - it is not recommended to permanently delete users:\nDeleting a user (2) Upon clicking the Delete button, the user will be moved to the Preserved users section:\nDeleting a user (3) They will no longer show up as a user on any CaaS hosts or in Keycloak. They can be easily restored by selecting the user and clicking the Restore button.\nManaging groups \u0026nbsp; When you deploy a cluster through CaaS, it may create one or more access control groups in FreeIPA as part of its configuration. Some clusters can also consume additional groups created in FreeIPA. This is discussed in more detail in the documentation for each cluster type, but the way you manage group membership is the same in all cases.\nCreating a new group \u0026nbsp; To create a new group, navigate to the Identity \u0026gt; Groups \u0026gt; User groups section and click the Add button:\nCreating a new group (1) In the resulting dialogue, set the Group name and, if you wish, a Description (recommended!). The Group Type can be left as POSIX , even if the group is only to be used for OpenID Connect. By leaving GID empty, a free GID will be allocated:\nCreating a new group (2) After clicking the Add button, the new group will be available for adding users.\nAdding and removing users \u0026nbsp; First, navigate to the Identity \u0026gt; Groups \u0026gt; User groups section:\nAdding/removing users (1) Click on the group that you want to add/remove users for to get to the details page for that group. To add users, click the Add button:\nAdding/removing users (2) In the dialogue that pops up, select the users you want to add and click the \u0026gt; button to move them from Available to Prospective :\nAdding/removing users (3) Adding/removing users (4) Click Add to add the users to the group.\nTo remove users from a group, select them in the user list for the group and click Delete :\nAdding/removing users (5) Upon confirmation, the users will be removed from the group.\nThe admins group \u0026nbsp; There is one special group that is created in FreeIPA by default, called admins. This group is respected by all cluster types and members are granted permissions across all clusters deployed using CaaS, including (but not limited to):\nFull admin access to the FreeIPA and Keycloak web interfaces SSH access to all hosts deployed using CaaS cluster-admin access to all Kubernetes clusters Access to all Pangeo clusters Managing OpenID Connect clients \u0026nbsp; For an application to use OpenID Connect to authenticate users, it must first be registered as a client with Keycloak. Clients are issued with an ID and secret so that Keycloak knows which application is making an authorisation request.\nTo manage your OpenID Connect clients, go to Keycloak at https://\u0026lt;gateway domain\u0026gt;/auth/ and click Administration Console. Upon signing in with valid admin credentials (see The admins group above) you will be redirected to the Keycloak admin console. Click on Clients in the menu to see the list of clients:\nKeycloak admin console Keycloak itself uses OpenID Connect to handle authentication for its web and command-line interfaces, so there are several clients related to Keycloak operations. CaaS will also automatically create new OpenID Connect clients for clusters that need them - most notably Kubernetes clusters - in which case the client will be named after the cluster. The client with Client ID kubernetes in the list above is an example of a client created by CaaS.\nIn order to configure an OpenID Connect client to talk to Keycloak, you also need the client secret. To find out the secret for a client, click on the client and then click on the Credentials tab:\nKeycloak: credentials tab The client secret is then shown in a disabled text box, where it can be copied from:\nKeycloak: client secret"

        content: "This article describes how to deploy and use a Kubernetes cluster using JASMIN Cluster-as-a-Service (CaaS).\nIntroduction \u0026nbsp; Kubernetes\u0026nbsp; is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling and management of containerised applications.\nKubernetes is an extremely powerful system, and a full discussion of its capabilities is beyond the scope of this article - please refer to the Kubernetes documentation. This article assumes some knowledge of Kubernetes terminology and focuses on things that are specific to the way Kubernetes is deployed by CaaS.\nIn CaaS, Kubernetes is deployed in a single-master configuration using Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)\u0026nbsp; . This configuration was chosen so that a single external IP can be used for SSH access to the cluster and for ingress\u0026nbsp; - external IPs are a scarce resource in the JASMIN Cloud and the number available to each tenancy is limited. It is for this reason that load-balancer services are also not available. Highly-available (HA) configurations may be available in the future.\nAll externally-exposed services, including the Kubernetes API, are authenticated using the Identity Manager, meaning that FreeIPA groups can be used to control access to the cluster.\nThe following services are also configured by CaaS (described in more detail later):\nThe Nginx Ingress Controller\u0026nbsp; The Openstack Cloud Provider\u0026nbsp; (Block Storage and Metadata only) Jetstack\u0026rsquo;s cert-manager\u0026nbsp; The Kubernetes dashboard\u0026nbsp; Cluster configuration \u0026nbsp; The following variables are available when creating a Kubernetes cluster:\nVariable Description Required? Can be updated? Identity manager The CaaS Identity Manager that is used to control access to the cluster. Yes No Version The Kubernetes version to use. The available versions are determined by the RKE version used by the CaaS configuration. This can be changed after initial deployment to upgrade a cluster to a newer Kubernetes version. Before doing this, you should back up your cluster - in particular, you should take a snapshot of the etcd database\u0026nbsp; and make sure any data in persistent volumes is backed up. Yes Yes Worker nodes The number of worker nodes in the cluster. This can be scaled up or down after deployment. When scaling down, there is currently no effort made to drain the hosts in order to remove them gracefully: we rely on Kubernetes to reschedule terminated pods. This may change in the future. Yes Yes Master size The size to use for the master node. The master node is configured to be unschedulable, so no user workloads will run on it (just system workloads). Yes No Worker size The size to use for worker nodes. Consider the workloads that you want to run and pick the size accordingly. The capacity of the cluster can be increased by adding more workers, but the size of each worker cannot be changed after the first deployment. Yes No Root volume size The size of the root volume of cluster nodes, in GB. This volume must be sufficiently large to hold the operating system (~3GB), all the Docker images used by your containers (which can be multiple GBs in size) and all the logs and ephemeral storage for your containers. For reference, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\u0026nbsp; deploys hosts with 100GB root disks by default. At least 40GB is recommended. Yes No External IP The external IP that will be attached to the master node. This IP is where the Kubernetes API will be exposed, and can be used for SSH access to the nodes. Yes No Admin IP ranges One or more IP ranges from which admins will access the Kubernetes API and dashboard (if enabled), in CIDR notation\u0026nbsp; . Any attempt to access the API or dashboard from an IP address that is not in these ranges will be blocked. Access to the Kubernetes API may allow the creation of resources in your cluster, so it is recommended that this range be as small as possible. If you are not sure what value to use here, contact your local network administrator to find out the appropriate value for your network. Yes Yes Kubernetes dashboard Indicates whether to deploy the Kubernetes dashboard. If selected, the Kubernetes dashboard will be available at the configured domain (see below). Yes Yes Dashboard domain The domain to use for the Kubernetes dashboard. If left empty, dashboard.\u0026lt;dashed-external-ip\u0026gt;.sslip.io is used. For example, if the selected external IP is 192.171.139.83, the domain will be dashboard.192-171-139-83.sslip.io. If given, the domain must already be configured to point to the selected External IP , otherwise configuration will fail. Only use this option if you have control over your own DNS entries - the CaaS system or Kubernetes will not create a DNS entry for you. No No Accessing the cluster \u0026nbsp; Kubernetes is configured to use the OpenID Connect support of the Identity Manager for authentication and authorisation. This means that all interactions with the cluster are authenticated and authorised against the users in FreeIPA, via the Keycloak integration.\nUsing the dashboard \u0026nbsp; If the option to deploy the dashboard was selected, the Kubernetes dashboard will be available at https://\u0026lt;dashboard domain\u0026gt;. Upon visiting the dashboard, you will be redirected to Keycloak to sign in:\nKeycloak sign-in screen Any user that exists in your FreeIPA database is able to log in to the dashboard, but only those with permissions assigned for the cluster will be able to see or do anything. Here is an example of what a user with no permissions will see:\nView for user with no permissions And here is an example of what a user with full admin rights will see (see Using Kubernetes RBAC below):\nView for user with full admin rights Using kubectl \u0026nbsp; This section assumes that you have kubectl\u0026nbsp; , the Kubernetes command-line client, installed on your workstation. In order to authenticate with Keycloak, you must also install the kubelogin\u0026nbsp; plugin, which provides OpenID Connect authentication for kubectl.\nIn order to configure OpenID Connect, you need to know the client ID and secret of the OpenID Connect client for your Kubernetes cluster in Keycloak. If you are an admin, you can find this information in the Keycloak admin console - the client will be named after the cluster. If you are not an admin, your admin should provide you with this information.\nUse the following commands to configure kubectl to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using your Identity Manager, replacing the variables with the correct values for your clusters:\n# Put the configuration in its own file export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig # Configure the cluster information kubectl config set-cluster kubernetes \\ --server https://$KUBERNETES_EXTERNAL_IP:6443 \\ --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true Cluster \u0026#34;kubernetes\u0026#34; set. # Configure the OpenID Connect authentication kubectl config set-credentials oidc \\ --auth-provider=oidc \\ --auth-provider-arg=idp-issuer-url=https://$ID_GATEWAY_DOMAIN/auth/realms/master \\ --auth-provider-arg=client-id=$CLIENT_ID \\ --auth-provider-arg=client-secret=$CLIENT_SECRET User \u0026#34;oidc\u0026#34; set. # Configure the context and set it to be the current context kubectl config set-context oidc@kubernetes --cluster kubernetes --user oidc Context \u0026#34;oidc@kubernetes\u0026#34; created. kubectl config use-context oidc@kubernetes Switched to context \u0026#34;oidc@kubernetes\u0026#34;. Once kubectl is configured, use the oidc-login plugin to authenticate with Keycloak and obtain an ID token. Running this command launches a temporary lightweight web server on your workstation that performs the authentication flow with Keycloak. A browser window will open where you enter your username and password:\nkubectl oidc-login Open http://localhost:8000 for authentication You got a valid token until 2019-07-11 21:58:06 +0100 BST Updated ./kubeconfig You can now use kubectl to query the Kubernetes resources to which you have been granted access:\nkubectl get nodes NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION kubernetes-master-0 Ready controlplane,etcd 12h v1.13.5 kubernetes-worker-0 Ready worker 12h v1.13.5 kubernetes-worker-1 Ready worker 12h v1.13.5 kubernetes-worker-2 Ready worker 12h v1.13.5 Using Kubernetes RBAC \u0026nbsp; Kubernetes includes a powerful Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system\u0026nbsp; . A full discussion of the RBAC system is beyond the scope of this documentation, but this section gives some examples of how RBAC in Kubernetes can be used in combination with FreeIPA groups to allow fine-grained access to the cluster.\nFor every Kubernetes cluster that is deployed, CaaS automatically creates a group in FreeIPA called \u0026lt;clustername\u0026gt;_users. This group, along with the admins group, are assigned the cluster-admin role using a ClusterRoleBinding, which grants super-user access to the entire cluster. In order to grant a user super-user access to the cluster, they just need to be added to one of these groups (depending on whether you want them to be a super-user on other clusters as well).\nIt is also possible to create additional groups in FreeIPA and attach more restrictive permissions to them.\nExample 1: Read-only cluster access \u0026nbsp; For example, suppose you have some auditors who require read-only access to the entire cluster in order to know what workloads are running. The first thing to do is create a group in FreeIPA - in this case, you might create a group called kubernetes_auditors. Once the group is created, you can reference it in Kubernetes by using the prefix oidc: - in this case the group would be referenced in Kubernetes as oidc:kubernetes_auditors. To grant read-only access to this group for the entire cluster, create a ClusterRoleBinding linking that group to the built-in view role:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: kubernetes-auditors-read roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: view subjects: - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Group name: oidc:kubernetes_auditors Example 2: Read-write namespace access \u0026nbsp; As another example, suppose you have some developers who want to deploy their app in your cluster, and you want to grant them read-write access to a single namespace to do this. Again, the first thing you would do is create a group in FreeIPA called, for example, myapp_developers. You can then assign this group the built-in edit role, but this time use a RoleBinding that is tied to a particular namespace:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: myapp-developers-edit namespace: myapp roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: edit subjects: - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Group name: oidc:myapp_developers Using the cluster \u0026nbsp; It is beyond the scope of this documentation to discuss how to use Kubernetes: please refer to the Kubernetes documentation for that. This section describes some things about the way Kubernetes is deployed by CaaS that will make a difference to how your applications are deployed.\nIngress \u0026nbsp; In CaaS Kubernetes, Ingress resources\u0026nbsp; are handled by the Nginx Ingress Controller\u0026nbsp; , which is exposed at the external IP used by the master node. The Ingress Controller supports a wide range of Ingress annotations that can be used to customise the behaviour for particular services - visit the documentation for more details.\nIn order to expose a service using an Ingress resource, each host given in the resource specification must have a DNS entry that points to the external IP of the master node (where the Ingress Controller is listening). CaaS or Kubernetes will not create these DNS records for you, and it is not possible to use an IP address as a host. If you cannot create or edit DNS records, you can use xip.io\u0026nbsp; (or similar services) - these are \u0026ldquo;magic domains\u0026rdquo; that provide DNS resolution for any IP address using domains of the form [subdomain.]\u0026lt;ip\u0026gt;.xip.io.\nTLS with cert-manager \u0026nbsp; CaaS Kubernetes deployments also include Jetstack\u0026rsquo;s cert- manager\u0026nbsp; , which provides Kubernetes- native resources for obtaining and renewing SSL certificates - visit the documentation for more information. CaaS installs a ClusterIssuer called letsencrypt that can automatically fetch and renew browser-trusted SSL certificates from Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt\u0026nbsp; using ACME\u0026nbsp; . By using annotations, certificates can be fetched automatically for Ingress resources:\napiVersion: extensions/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: myapp annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \u0026#34;nginx\u0026#34; cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: \u0026#34;letsencrypt\u0026#34; spec: tls: - hosts: - example.example.com secretName: myapp-tls # This secret will be created by cert-manager rules: - host: example.example.com http: paths: - path: / pathType: prefix backend: service name: myapp port: number: 8080 Storage \u0026nbsp; CaaS Kubernetes is also configured to take advantage of the fact that it is running on Openstack\u0026nbsp; . In particular, a storage class\u0026nbsp; is installed that can dynamically provision Cinder\u0026nbsp; volumes in response to [persistent volume claims]( https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-\u0026nbsp; volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) being created. This storage class is called csi-cinder-sc-delete, and is consumed like this:\napiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: myclaim spec: storageClassName: csi-cinder-sc-delete accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 10GiIf there is enough quota available, this persistent volume claim should result in a new Cinder volume being provisioned and bound to the claim. The Cinder volume will show up in the Volumes tab of the JASMIN Cloud Portal with a name of the form kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-\u0026lt;uuid\u0026gt;."

        content: "This article describes how to deploy and use a Pangeo cluster using JASMIN Cluster-as-a-Service (CaaS).\nIntroduction \u0026nbsp; Pangeo\u0026nbsp; is a community that promotes a philosophy of open, scalable and reproducible science, focusing primarily on the geosciences. As part of that effort, the Pangeo community provides a curated Python\u0026nbsp; ecosystem based on popular open-source packages like xarray\u0026nbsp; , Iris\u0026nbsp; , Dask\u0026nbsp; and Jupyter notebooks\u0026nbsp; , along with documentation and recipes for deployment on various infrastructures.\nThe Pangeo cluster type in CaaS is a multi-user implementation of the Pangeo ecosystem using JupyterHub\u0026nbsp; deployed on Kubernetes\u0026nbsp; , giving users a scalable and fault- tolerant infrastructure to use for doing science, all through a web-browser interface. Authentication is handled by the Identity Manager for the tenancy via JupyterHub\u0026rsquo;s LDAP integration. Each authenticated user gets their own Jupyter notebook environment running in its own container, isolated from other users. The automatic spawning of containers for authenticated users is handled by JupyterHub, which also provides an interface for admins to manage the running containers. This is achieved by using the Pangeo Helm chart\u0026nbsp; to deploy the Pangeo ecosystem on a CaaS Kubernetes cluster.\nCluster configuration \u0026nbsp; The Pangeo ecosystem is deployed on top of CaaS Kubernetes, so all the configuration variables for Kubernetes also apply to Pangeo clusters.\nIn addition, the following variables are available to configure the Pangeo installation:\nVariable Description Required? Can be updated? Notebook CPUs The number of CPUs to allocate to each user notebook environment. Yes Yes Notebook RAM The amount of RAM, in GB, to allocate to each user notebook environment. Yes Yes Notebook storage The amount of persistent storage, in GB, to allocate to each user notebook environment. This is where users will store their notebooks and any other files they import. The storage is persistent across notebook restarts - a user can shut down their notebook server and start a new server later without losing their data. Backups are not provided - if required, they are the responsibility of the user or cluster admins. Yes Yes Pangeo domain The domain to use for the Pangeo notebook web interface.\nIf left empty, pangeo.\u0026lt;dashed-external-ip\u0026gt;.sslip.io is used. For example, if the selected external IP is 192.171.139.83, the domain will be pangeo.192-171-139-83.sslip.io.\nIf given, the domain must already be configured to point to the selected External IP (see Kubernetes configuration), otherwise configuration will fail. Only use this option if you have control over your own DNS entries - the CaaS system or Kubernetes will not create a DNS entry for you. No No These variables define the amount of resource available to each user for processing - in order to appropriately configure (a) the size of your cluster worker nodes and (b) the resources for each notebook environment, you will need to consider how many users you are expecting and what workloads they might want to run.\nAccessing the cluster \u0026nbsp; Access to the underlying Kubernetes cluster is achieved in the same way as any other CaaS Kubernetes cluster.\nThe Pangeo web interface will be available at https://\u0026lt;pangeo domain\u0026gt;. Access to the Pangeo interface is managed through FreeIPA, and users sign in with the same username and password as for other clusters. As part of the cluster configuration, CaaS will create a FreeIPA group called \u0026lt;clustername\u0026gt;_notebook_users. Granting access to the Pangeo interface is as simple as adding a user to this group.\nBefore adding user to group:\nAdding user to group: before And after:\nAdding user to group: after Using the Pangeo environment \u0026nbsp; A full discussion of the capabilities of Jupyter notebooks, the JupyterLab environment and the many libraries included in the Pangeo ecosystem is beyond the scope of this documentation. There are plenty of examples on the web, and Pangeo provide some example notebooks\u0026nbsp; .\nAs a very brief example of the power and simplicity of Jupyter notebooks, especially on Kubernetes, this short video (no sound) shows a user signing into a CaaS Pangeo cluster and uploading a notebook. When run, the notebook spawns a Dask cluster inside Kubernetes and uses it to perform a noddy but relatively time-consuming calculation. You can see the Dask cluster scale up to meet demand in the Dask dashboard:\nAdministering the hub \u0026nbsp; JupyterHub allows admin users to manage the notebooks running in the system, and even to impersonate other users. Unfortunately, the JupyterHub LDAP integration does not currently allow for an entire group to be designated as admins, so admin access in JupyterHub is granted specifically to the FreeIPA admin user.\nTo access the admin section, first click Hub \u0026gt; Control Panel in the JupyterLab interface:\nAdministering the hub (1) This will open the JupyterHub control panel - any user can use this to start and stop their notebook server, but admins see an extra Admin tab:\nAdministering the hub (2) Clicking on this tab will show a list of the users in the hub, along with buttons to start and stop the servers for those users:\nAdministering the hub (3) Additional admins can be added by clicking the edit user button for that user. This will pop up a dialogue:\nAdministering the hub (4) Check the Admin checkbox and click Edit User to save. The user is now an admin for the hub."

We are working on a new system which will provide slurm clusters. Introduction \u0026nbsp; The Slurm Workload Manager\u0026nbsp; is a popular open- source job scheduler. It provides facilities for executing and monitoring workloads across a set of nodes and managing contention for those nodes by maintaining a queue of pending jobs.\nSlurm is a powerful scheduling system, and a full discussion of the available commands and options is beyond the discussion of this article - please consult the Slurm documentation. This article focuses on the specifics of how to deploy and access a Slurm cluster in CaaS.\nIn CaaS, a Slurm cluster consists of a single login node and several worker nodes. The Linux users and groups on the cluster are managed by the Identity Manager for the tenancy, meaning that SSH access to the nodes can be controlled using FreeIPA groups. User home directories are mounted on all nodes using a shared storage cluster. Slurm is configured with a single queue, to which all the compute hosts are added.\nThe login node can optionally be assigned an external IP, however external IPs are a scarce resource in the JASMIN Cloud - if you want to preserve your external IPs for other clusters, you can use the Identity Manager gateway host as a jump host.\nCluster configuration \u0026nbsp; The following variables are available to configure a Slurm cluster:\nVariable Description Required? Can be updated? Identity manager The CaaS Identity Manager that is used to control access to the cluster. Yes No Shared storage The shared storage cluster to use for user home directories. Yes No Worker nodes The number of worker nodes in the cluster. This can be scaled up or down after deployment. When scaling down, there is currently no effort made to drain the hosts in order to remove them gracefully: jobs executing on the removed hosts will fail. This may change in the future. Yes Yes Login node size The size to use for the login node. Yes No Compute node size The size to use for the compute nodes. Yes No External IP The external IP to attach to the login node. This is optional - if not given, the cluster can still be accessed by using the Identity Manager\u0026rsquo;s gateway host as a jump host for SSH. No No Accessing the cluster \u0026nbsp; The Slurm hosts are configured to use the users and groups from FreeIPA using SSSD\u0026nbsp; . They are also configured to use SSH keys from FreeIPA for SSH authentication (password-based SSH is disabled).\nFor every Slurm cluster that is deployed, CaaS automatically creates a group in FreeIPA called \u0026lt;clustername\u0026gt;_users. This group, along with the admins group, are permitted SSH access to the hosts in the cluster. To permit a user SSH access to a Slurm cluster, they just need to be added to one of these groups (depending on whether you also want them to be an admin on other clusters).\nOnce they have been added to one of these groups, the Slurm cluster can be accessed via SSH. The following is an example of accessing a Slurm cluster without an external IP using the Identity Manager\u0026rsquo;s gateway as a jump host:\n# Add SSH key to the session ssh-add /path/to/ssh/key # SSH to the identity manager gateway with agent forwarding enabled ssh -A jbloggs@192.171.139.83 # SSH to the Slurm login node ssh 192.168.3.16 # Check that we are in our home directory pwd /home/users/jbloggs # Check the Slurm status sinfo PARTITION AVAIL TIMELIMIT NODES STATE NODELIST compute* up 1-00:00:00 3 idle slurm-compute-[0-2] # Run a simple job srun -N3 -l /bin/hostname 0: slurm-compute-0.novalocal 1: slurm-compute-1.novalocal 2: slurm-compute-2.novalocal A more in-depth discussion of the capabilities of Slurm is beyond the scope of this document - please refer to the Slurm documentation."

The priority of the effort so far has been to target specific scientific themes focusing on selected Essential Climate Variables, a range of known systematic biases common to ESMs, such as coupled tropical climate variability, monsoons, Southern Ocean processes, continental dry biases and soil hydrology-climate interactions, as well as atmospheric CO2 budgets, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, and tropospheric aerosols.\nThe tool is being developed in such a way that additional analyses can easily be added. A set of standard recipes for each scientific topic reproduces specific sets of diagnostics or performance metrics that have demonstrated their importance in ESM evaluation in the peer-reviewed literature. The ESMValTool is a community effort open to both users and developers encouraging open exchange of diagnostic source code and evaluation results from the CMIP ensemble. This will facilitate and improve ESM evaluation beyond the state-of- the-art and aims at supporting such activities within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and at individual modelling centres. Ultimately, we envisage running the ESMValTool alongside the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) as part of a more routine evaluation of CMIP model simulations while utilizing observations available in standard formats (obs4MIPs) or provided by the user.\nInstallation as a \u0026ldquo;community package\u0026rdquo; on JASMIN \u0026nbsp; ESMValTool is installed on JASMIN as a community package.

If you have queries about using ESMValTool on JASMIN then please contact the JASMIN Helpdesk and we will forward them to the team that supports this package on JASMIN.\nMain Features \u0026nbsp; ESMValTool has the following features:\nFacilitates the complex evaluation of ESMs and their simulations submitted to international Model Intercomparison Projects (e.g., CMIP). Standardized model evaluation can be performed against observations, against other models or to compare different versions of the same model. Wide scope: includes many diagnostics and performance metrics covering different aspects of the Earth System (dynamics, radiation, clouds, carbon cycle, chemistry, aerosol, sea-ice, etc.) and their interactions. Well-established analysis: standard namelists reproduce specific sets of diagnostics or performance metrics that have demonstrated their importance in ESM evaluation in the peer-reviewed literature. road documentation: a user guide (Eyring et al., 2015); SPHINX; a log-file is written containing all the information of a specific call of the main script: creation date of running the script, version number, analyzed data (models and observations), applied diagnostics and variables, and corresponding references. This helps to increase the traceability and reproducibility of the results. High flexibility: new diagnostics and more observational data can be easily added. Multi-language support: Python, NCL, R\u0026hellip; other open-source languages are possible. CF/CMOR compliant: data from many different projects can be handled (CMIP, obs4mips, ana4mips, CCMI, CCMVal, AEROCOM, etc.). Routines are provided to CMOR-ize non-compliant data. Integration in modelling workflows: for EMAC, NOAA-GFDL and NEMO, can be easily extended. Quick User Guide on JASMIN \u0026nbsp; The latest version of ESMValTool is available for users on JASMIN and can be accessed via a standard module:\nmodule load esmvaltool To run a yaml-formatted recipe:\nesmvaltool run recipe.yml For a complete guide on how to configure the tool, set up and run available diagnostic recipes please consult the documentation at: https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/\u0026nbsp; Further information \u0026nbsp; Documentation: https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/\u0026nbsp; Website: https://www.esmvaltool.org/index.html\u0026nbsp; GitHub: https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool\u0026nbsp; github.com\u0026nbsp;"

        content: "Introduction \u0026nbsp; The Jaspy environment on JASMIN contains the GNU compilers and MPICH\u0026nbsp; , plus a wide range of libraries from conda-forge that will interoperate with these.\nSeparately, we also provide the Intel OneAPI compilers\u0026nbsp; and Intel MPI\u0026nbsp; , and a much more limited set of libraries built with these (currently just the netCDF libraries and their dependencies).\nIn either case, to compile and link software that utilises these libraries, you need to:\nensure that you are using the correct compiler point to the location of the libraries This page provides details on how to do this, first for Jaspy/GNU and then for Intel OneAPI.\nUsing Jaspy and the GNU compilers \u0026nbsp; Loading the compilers \u0026nbsp; To ensure that you are using the correct compilers, simply use the command\nmodule load jaspyto load the Jaspy module or\nmodule load jaspy/3.11/v20240508to load a specific Jaspy version.\nThis will put the directory containing the GNU compilers (gcc, g++, gfortran) into your PATH. That directory also contains the corresponding MPI compiler wrappers (mpicc, mpicxx, mpif77, mpif90) which you can use instead of using gcc etc directly if you want to compile parallel code.\nLoading the module also sets the CONDA_PREFIX environment variable to point to the root of the relevant Jaspy installation, for example /apps/jasmin/jaspy/miniforge_envs/jaspy3.11/mf3-23.11.0-0/envs/jaspy3.11-mf3-23.11.0-0-v20240815.\n(The directory which gets added to PATH as described above is equivalent to $CONDA_PREFIX/bin.)\nYou can use the which command to verify that you are using the correct compiler versions, for example, type:\nwhich gfortranThis should report a path that is under the directory mentioned above.\nIf instead you see a compiler path under /usr/bin, then this is a different compiler version (provided by the operating system), and is not compatible with the libraries in Jaspy or supported by the JASMIN helpdesk for running user code. In that case, check your $PATH.\nPointing to the libraries \u0026nbsp; To use the libraries under the Jaspy environment, you need to add the following additional flags to the compiler command line:\nAt the compilation stage, you need to point to the include/ subdirectory containing header files. If making use of the CONDA_PREFIX environment variable, this would mean using this compiler option: -I$CONDA_PREFIX/include At the linking stage, you need to point to the lib/ subdirectory containing the libraries themselves. This will require the following linker option: -L$CONDA_PREFIX/liband is in addition to the relevant -l options for the specific libraries that you want to link to (for example -lfftw3 to use libfftw3.so).\nIf you are compiling and linking in a single step, put both of the above options on the same command line.\nIf you are running the compiler indirectly via an installer for another package, rather than running the compiler commands directly yourself, note that there are environment variables which are commonly used to specify these options, which you would set before invoking the installer. For example:\nexport CFLAGS=\u0026#34;-I$CONDA_PREFIX/include\u0026#34; export LDFLAGS=\u0026#34;-L$CONDA_PREFIX/lib\u0026#34;although the names of these might differ slightly (for example COPTS instead of CFLAGS, maybe FFLAGS or F77FLAGS or F90FLAGS as appropriate), so check the instructions for the package that you are trying to build.\nUsing *-config scripts \u0026nbsp; As an alternative to pointing explicitly to the relevant include and lib directories, some of the software packages provide *-config executables which report the relevant flags to be used during compilation. This includes, for exmple, the netCDF C library and also its Fortran / C++ wrappers; these provide nc-config, nf-config, and ncxx4-config. See ls $CONDA_PREFIX/bin/*-config for a list of other similar executables. Provided that the directory containing these is in your PATH (as will be the case after loading the Jaspy module), the output of these commands can be captured by a script and used to provide the relevant compiler and linker options, without you needing to specify any paths explicitly. For example, a program myprog.c that uses the netCDF C library could be compiled and linked using:\n# first set some variables using the nc-config script cc=$(nc-config --cc) cflags=$(nc-config --cflags) libs=$(nc-config --libs) # now use these variables to construct the relevant commands $cc -c $cflags myprog.c $cc $libs myprog.o -o myprogIf you are building a third-party package that depends on netCDF and which utilises the nc-config script in this way, then after you have loaded the Jaspy module, you should not need to do anything else in order to tell it where the library is located.\n(The nc-config program can also provide other information about the build of the library that you are using; type nc-config --help for more info.)\nUsing the Intel OneAPI compilers \u0026nbsp; Components of the Intel OneAPI\u0026nbsp; are provided for use with the Rocky 9 sci servers and Rocky 9 LOTUS nodes.\nIt is advisable to unload the Jaspy module when using the Intel compilers, to avoid any compatibility issues.\nLoading the compilers \u0026nbsp; If Jaspy is already loaded, start by typing\nmodule unload jaspythen:\nmodule load oneapi/compilersthis will enable the following commands:\nthe Fortran compiler ifx the C compiler icx the C++ compiler icpx (Typing ifort will give a deprecation warning, so use ifx instead.)\nIn addition to these, the OneAPI suite also includes an MPI implementation. You can load this by typing:\nmodule load oneapi/mpiThis provides (amongst other things):\ncompiler wrappers mpif77, mpif90, mpicc, mpicxx the run-time wrapper mpirun (which can also be invoked as mpiexec) NetCDF libraries for use with Intel OpenAPI \u0026nbsp; CEDA has provided an installation of the netCDF C library that uses the OneAPI compilers, together with its dependencies (HDF5, pnetcdf). Fortran and C++ language wrappers are also provided.\nThis installation is built with support for parallel access, although the user code needs to request parallel mode when opening the file in order to utilise this. Parallel netCDF makes use of the Intel MPI library.\nTo use Intel OneAPI, type one (or more) of these module commands:\nFor the C library - also includes associated command-line utilities, ncdump etc: module load netcdf/intel2024.2.0/4.9.2 For the C library and C++ wrappers: module load netcdf/intel2024.2.0/c++/4.3.1 For the C library and Fortran wrappers: module load netcdf/intel2024.2.0/fortran/4.6.1Loading these netCDF modules will also load the relevant compiler and MPI modules, so you do not need to load those explicitly.\nAs in the case of GNU compilers described above, you will have two approaches available for compiling netCDF code: either to point to the libraries explicitly, or to use the *-config scripts. These are described in more detail below.\nPointing to the libraries \u0026nbsp; Once you have loaded these modules, the environment variable NETCDF_ROOT is set for you, and as appropriate, NETCDFF_ROOT (for Fortran) and/or NETCDF_CXX4_ROOT (for C++). These variables are not generally used by the software, but may be useful to you when writing your own scripts in order to refer to the location of the libraries. They can be used analogously to how CONDA_PREFIX is used in the Jaspy/GNU examples above, as follows (assuming again that your program is called myprog):\nC ## compile: cx -c myprog.c -I$NETCDF_ROOT/include ## link: icx -o myprog myprog.o -L$NETCDF_ROOT/lib -lnetcdf Fortran: ## compile: ifx -c myprog.f -I$NETCDFF_ROOT/include ## (also works with F90) ## link: ifx -o myprog myprog.o -L$NETCDFF_ROOT/lib -lnetcdff -L$NETCDF_ROOT/lib -lnetcdf C++: ## compile: icpx -c myprog.cpp -I$NETCDF_ROOT/include -I$NETCDF_CXX4_ROOT/include ## link: icpx -o myprog myprog.o -L$NETCDF_CXX4_ROOT/lib -lnetcdf_c++4 -L$NETCDF_ROOT/lib -lnetcdf Parallel example (Fortran): ## compile and link: mpif90 -o myprog myprog.F90 -I $NETCDFF_ROOT/include -L $NETCDFF_ROOT/lib -lnetcdff ## run: mpirun -np 4 ./myprogA runnable example script that demonstrates these with some test programs from Unidata can be found at:\n/apps/jasmin/supported/libs/netcdf/intel2024.2.0/intel_netcdf_examples.shIf running the parallel test, ensure that you are using a filesystem that supports parallel writes.\nUsing the *-config scripts \u0026nbsp; Just as described above when using Jaspy, you will have the directories containing executables nc-config, nf-config, and ncxx4-config in your $PATH, provided that you have loaded the relevant modules. (In fact, these will be in $NETCDF_ROOT/bin, $NETCDFF_ROOT/bin, $NETCDF_CXX4_ROOT/bin, but you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to refer to these paths explicitly.)\nFollow the same approach as described above, capturing the output of these commands when run with the relevant command-line options. (Search for nc-config above in this page.) The build script for your application should then look exactly the same as if you were using Jaspy, apart from loading a different module to start with, even though the actual compiler options will be different."

        content: "\u0026nbsp; Important changes took place in September 2024 affecting what software can be used on JASMIN. Please read this announcement\u0026nbsp; carefully.\nThis supersedes the information below which has yet to be updated in line with this.\nIntroduction \u0026nbsp; This article describes two types of software environments that you can create in order to install packages for your own use on JASMIN. Typical examples why you may wish to do this is if you have asked us to add packages to Jaspy but wish to make use of them before the next release, or if they are not likely to be relevant to other users.\nSeparate pages explain the details of how to create and install Python virtual environments and Conda environments. This page gives an overview of what they are, and how to choose which one is most suitable for your needs.\nDescription of Python virtual environments and Conda environments \u0026nbsp; A Python virtual environment is a relatively lightweight environment, which is used for running Python packages, typically installed using the \u0026ldquo;pip\u0026rdquo; installer from the Python Package Index pypi\u0026nbsp; or locally from Python source containing a setup.py file. This enables you to install packages in your home directory without writing to the underlying Python installation itself (for example when you do not have write permission), and you can have any number of separate virtual environments and \u0026ldquo;activate\u0026rdquo; the relevant one when needed. When you run pip to install a Python package, additional Python packages may be installed automatically in order to satisfy dependencies. Depending on the package being installed, if it requires compiled libraries to accompany it, it may try to compile these locally, but depending what development libraries are available, occasionally this might not succeed. By contrast, a Conda environment is a much bulkier, more fully featured environment, using the mamba or conda package managers. This enables the installation of packages from conda channels, usually conda-forge\u0026nbsp; , which are not restricted to being Python packages. Where packages contain compiled libraries, these are generally available as pre-compiled binaries. As with python virtual environments, you can have any number of these environments and activate the required one. When you run the mamba or conda installer, similarly it will install whatever additional packages are required in order to satisfy dependencies. (It is also possible to use the pip installer when working with conda environments.) Various versions of the conda installer are available, but for use on JASMIN, we now ask users to use Miniforge, for licensing reasons. Environment size \u0026nbsp; To take an example of the size, a new Python virtual environment without additional packages occupies about 10MB and contains under 1000 files (maybe approximately twice this if using the --system-site-packages option explained in more detail elsewhere), whereas as a new conda base environment occupies about 400MB and contains over 20,000 files.\nInstallation examples \u0026nbsp; To give an example of installing a Python package, the numexpr library is a numerical expression evaluator for NumPy. It is available as a pip package called numexpr, and also as a conda package called numexpr. (For some packages, the two may have slightly different names.) It can be installed successfully into either a Python virtual environment using pip install numexpr or a conda environment using mamba install numexpr (or conda install numexpr). In either case, the numpy package on which it depends, amongst other things, will be installed automatically if required.\nTo give an example of installing a non-python package, zsh is a Unix shell which combines various features of bash and csh. You cannot install this using pip install because it is not a python package, but it is available on conda-forge, and can be installed into a conda environment using mamba install zsh.\nCombining environments \u0026nbsp; We already provide a wide range of packages via Jaspy. This is in itself a conda environment, and it is important to note that although you can use a Python virtual environment to install additional packages when using a conda environment, you cannot have more than one conda environment activated at the same time.\nWhen using Python virtual environments, you are advised to start by activating a Jaspy environment, as this will ensure that you are using a version of Python that we support, as well as significantly increasing the range of compiled libraries available during the pip install process. You can also use the --system-site-packages option to access the Python packages provided by Jaspy itself, as described in more detail on the virtual environments help page. However, if you choose to use your own conda environment, then you will activate it instead of Jaspy, and you will need to install into it everything that you will need to accompany the package which you wish to use. Note that because you can install pip packages into conda environment, it is not generally useful to create a virtual environment in order to extend your own private conda environment. The reason for creating one to extend Jaspy is that users do not have write permission to add packages to Jaspy itself.\nChoosing between a Python virtual environment and a Conda environment \u0026nbsp; Because python virtual environments are much more lightweight that conda environments, and also give you access to packages that we provide via Jaspy, we would generally recommend that you start by trying a Python virtual environment. However, this might prove not to be possible, for example because:\nThe package that you wish to install is not available via PyPI (perhaps it is not a Python package). The package that you wish to install depends on compiled libraries that do not build successfully during a pip install. Often pre-compiled versions will be available from conda-forge. If you do decide to install a conda environment, then remember to install additional packages that you might otherwise have used via Jaspy."

        description: "Removal of packages from anaconda \"defaults\" channel in user environments on JASMIN",
        
        
        content: "Background \u0026nbsp; Following a change in the licensing conditions by Anaconda, it is now the case that all users of the Anaconda defaults Conda package channel (repository) from organisations of 500 or more employees are potentially liable to pay for usage, even if it is for the purpose of academic research.\nThis does not affect packages from the community channel conda-forge, which remains free to use, as also does the conda installer program itself.\nIt has to be assumed that JASMIN users in general would potentially be subject to contractual liability if Conda packages from the defaults channel are used, so it has been decided that these are not to be used on JASMIN.\nThe JASMIN team have now taken steps to ensure that centrally-provided environments including Jaspy make use only of conda-forge, but as regards packages in users\u0026rsquo; own directories, the responsibility falls on individual users to do the same.\nThese days, the miniforge installer is available to install conda environments, and this will install packages from conda-forge by default, but we have found there to be many user conda environments on JASMIN which contain packages from defaults \u0026ndash; either because these environments pre-date the use of miniforge, or because the channel was specified explicitly during installation \u0026ndash; and these need to be addressed.\nBecause of the sometimes complex dependencies between packages in conda channels, it is difficult to automate the removal of packages from the defaults channel, if the desired end result is a usable conda environment containing equivalent packages from conda-forge. Some manual decision-making may be needed, and this document is a guide to help you to do this.\nIn cases where users take no action, ultimately it might become necessary for JASMIN staff to remove affected packages in an automated way from user\u0026rsquo;s conda environments, but this would be likely to impair the usability of those environments, and it is not our preferred course of action.\nPlease note that this page is a best-efforts guide only. Ultimately you are responsible for the contents of the conda environments in your own user directories (including group workspaces, etc). We cannot warrant that following these instructions will succeed in removing all the packages for which you could incur charges, despite that being the intention. Any feedback for improvements of this document is welcome.\nWhat conda environments do I have? \u0026nbsp; You can generally discover which conda environments you have created, by typing conda env list (when you have an environment activated), or by looking in your ~/.conda/environments.txt file. Occasionally, for some reason some environments might not be listed, so here are some other likely places where you might find conda environments that you have created:\nUnder ~/miniconda3/envs or ~/anaconda3/envs or ~/miniconda3/envs or ~/mambaforge3/envs. Also variants of the above without the 3, or with a 2 in place of the 3 (for environments created using the Python 2 installer versions). Under ~/.conda/envs (note the dot). (If you have used a custom directory), in other subdirectories of the same envs directories as used by the other conda environments that are displayed by conda env list. Note that if you have created named conda environments, you will usually also have the associated installer base environments. For example, if you have environment ~/miniconda3/envs/myenv then the base environment is at ~/miniconda3.\nWhich channels do my installed conda packages use? \u0026nbsp; There are various ways to list the contents of an environment: the names of the packages and the channels they come from. Select one of the following:\nTo get a list of packages with their channel names, activate the environment and then type conda list. However, note that if the channel is not mentioned in the output, then the package is from the defaults channel (also known as main). The list will also include any pip-installed packages, and these will say pypi instead of a conda channel.\nOr to display the channel URL for each of the packages, inspect the JSON files in the conda-meta subdirectory of the environment. After activating the environment (which sets the CONDA_PREFIX variable), you could type:\ngrep \u0026#39;\u0026#34;channel\u0026#34;\u0026#39; $CONDA_PREFIX/conda-meta/*.json There is also a file called $CONDA_PREFIX/conda-meta/history containing: the commands that you used in order to install packages (see lines beginning with # cmd), which packages were installed (lines beginning +), and which were removed (lines beginning -). In each case, the channel name is shown along with the package. Whichever of these you do, any packages that are from the main / defaults channel are part of the paid offering, and will need to be removed. If any exist, these should show up in the list of channel URLs as being under https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/ (or https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/ for the R language packages).\nHowever, especially because the conda list output does not list a channel name where it is defaults, the safest approach may be to list everything that is not from conda-forge, and then remove these packages unless they are from known free channels. So after activating the environment, you could type:\nconda list | egrep -vw `conda-forge|pypi` (Note that if the environment is already clear of any such packages, you will still see the header lines in the output of this command, so if you see no output at all then something went wrong.)\nHow do I replace packages that use the defaults channel? \u0026nbsp; Once you have identified which environments you have and which packages in them are from the main / defaults channel, here is how to go about replacing these packages with equivalents from conda-forge.\nBefore starting on this procedure, check whether you have a file called ~/.condarc. If you do, and if it contains a line that references the defaults channel, then remove that line.\nBase environments \u0026nbsp; First, let\u0026rsquo;s deal with the base environments.\nYour approach to the base environments will depend on whether these were installed using the miniforge/mambaforge installers, or miniconda/anaconda.\nminiforge / mambaforge base environments \u0026nbsp; You should hopefully have found that it is already true that any such base environments only contain packages from the conda-forge channel, so that you do not have to do anything with these. (In the unlikely event that this is not the case, then deal with them as per the advice for named environments given below.) Furthermore, the conda or mamba commands that they provide in order to install other environments should default to only using conda-forge (provided that you don\u0026rsquo;t have a ~/.condarc file that overrides this).\nminiconda / anaconda base environments \u0026nbsp; (You can skip this subsection if you don\u0026rsquo;t have any miniconda/anaconda base environments.)\nBy contrast to the above, these base environments will contain packages from the defaults channel, and also, the conda command in these environments will by default try to install packages from that channel. For this reason, we recommend that these base environments should be deleted completely.\nIf the base environment does not contain (inside its envs subdirectory) any named environments that you wish to keep, then you can simply delete it, for example: rm -fr ~/miniconda3\nHowever, if it does, then you can keep the envs subdirectory and delete the subdirectories other than envs, for example by doing:\ncd ~/miniconda3 mkdir to-delete mv * to-delete/ mv to-delete/envs ./ ls to-delete # check what we are about to delete rm -rf to-delete You won\u0026rsquo;t need the miniconda base environment just in order to use one of the named sub-environments inside it, because you can instead use a miniforge base environment to provide the conda and mamba executables. If you do not already have miniforge installed, you can get the installer here\u0026nbsp; .\nAssuming that you have installed a miniforge base environment at ~/miniforge3, you can activate one of your old miniconda environments by specifying its full path after activating the base environment. For example, this might look like:\nsource ~/miniforge3/bin/activate conda activate ~/miniconda3/envs/myenv (Do not be tempted just to move the environment to a new path under ~/miniforge3/envs in order to avoid the need to type the full path, because it will probably contain hard-coded paths which would not work if it is moved. However, you could create a symbolic link.)\nRemember that in the sub-environments you are keeping, you will need to purge any packages that use the paid channels, as described below.\nNamed environments \u0026nbsp; By this point, your only base environment(s) should be miniforge (or mambaforge) environments, but you may have a number of named environments that contain packages from the defaults channel, which need dealing with.\nMostly, any such named environments will be ones that were created using miniconda (which you will now activate via the miniforge base environment as described above). However it could still arise that you have mambaforge environments containing packages from defaults, if this was specified either in your .condarc file or in a .yml file that you used to create the environment.\nHow you deal with these environments will probably depend on the number of packages from the defaults channel that they contain. We would suggest that if they only contain a small number, then you can attempt to patch the existing environment, but if they contain a larger number then it will be best to create a new environment with similar contents but from conda-forge. Here are the details:\nPatching an existing environment \u0026nbsp; This is a suggested approach where you have an environment that only has a small number of packages that are from the defaults channel.\nActivate the environment.\nTry typing conda remove followed on the command line by a list of the affected packages, and see which packages it proposes to remove, bearing in mind that if other packages depend on the ones in question, they will be included also.\nIf the list is reasonably short, then confirm the changes, and after that, reinstall the packages, including any dependent packages, using\nconda install -c conda-forge --override-channels package1 [package2...] substituting here the names of the relevant packages. (The installation options shown above should make sure that new the packages come from conda-forge, even if there is still some .condarc file that says otherwise.)\nYou can also use mamba instead of conda here, to use the mamba installer.\nOnce you have done this, remember to recheck the list of packages and channels. (For example, if you do conda list, do they now all show up as being from conda-forge?)\nIf the list of dependencies is unacceptably long, then answer no. You will probably have to recreate the environment instead, as shown below. (You could perhaps instead attempt to reinstall the relevant packages by adding the --force-reinstall option on the conda install command instead of a separate conda remove step first, but when we tried an example, this did not succeed \u0026ndash; there may be dependencies on exact release versions, for example.)\nRecreating an environment \u0026nbsp; This suggestion is for where too many changes are needed to be able to modify the existing environment easily.\nIt is important to note that although there is a possible procedure for obtaining an exact copy of an environment (namely: export a list of packages to a file including all the exact version and release numbers, and then use it to create the new environment), the aim here is, rather, to produce an equivalent environment based on packages from conda-forge. Package releases will differ slightly from what is available in the defaults channel. So it will be best to be avoid constraining the requirements too rigidly, in order give the installer the flexibility it needs to choose mutually compatible versions of all of the packages.\nThe aim, therefore, will be to repeat the steps that you used (for example, install matplotlib), rather than try to replicate the exact versions that you ended up with.\nYou can see what conda install commands you ran previously, by going to the environment directory of the old environment (if you have activated the environment, this will be at $CONDA_PREFIX), and typing:\ngrep \u0026#34;# cmd\u0026#34; conda-meta/history In addition to any conda install commands, it is possible that you also installed Python packages using pip install. The specific commands will probably not have been recorded (other than the limited record in your ~/.bash_history file), but if you activate the old environment and type pip freeze, this shows which Python packages are installed. To see just the ones that were not installed via conda packages, type:\npip freeze | grep -v \u0026#34; @ \u0026#34; Note that this list will contain any packages that were installed automatically for dependencies, in addition to the ones that you installed explicitly.\nOnce you have obtained this information, you are in a position to repeat the installation. First ensure that you have deactivated any other conda environments in your session, and then activate your miniforge base environment. Depending where this is located, a typical example would be:\nsource activate ~/miniforge3/bin/activate Then you will repeat the conda install commands that you typed \u0026ndash; or optionally, replace conda create with mamba create to use the (more efficient) mamba installer (and likewise with mamba env create and mamba create where appropriate). Note the following:\nIf you created the old environment using conda env create and a .yml file, and you still have this file available, then before reusing it, look at the channels section (usually near the top), and edit to to ensure that conda-forge is listed and defaults is not.\nIf you used conda env create but no longer have the .yml file, then see below for an alternative approach.\nAfter you have created the environment, remember to activate it before issuing any later conda install (or mamba install) commands. Otherwise you will end up installing the packages into your base environment instead.\nThen install the additional pip packages, using pip install [package_name]. Again, this should be after activating the environment. Note that:\nYou only need to name the packages that your code is importing explicitly; any dependencies will be installed for you.\nRemove the version requirements (e.g. pip install dask instead of pip install dask=2023.2.0) if you wish to install a recent version instead of the originally used version.\nIf you created the environment from a .yml file that contains a pip section, then some or all of these may already have been installed for you by this stage.\nYou can also put multiple package requirements into a file (typically called requirements.txt) and install them using pip install -r [filename]. For example, it might be more convenient to do this if you choose to reinstall everything that was reported when you ran the pip freeze | grep -v \u0026quot; @ \u0026quot; command in the old environment, rather than a selected few packages.\nOnce you have got your new environment installed and working, remember to delete the old one.\nWhat to do if a previously used YAML file is no longer available \u0026nbsp; If you do not have a record of packages based on the conda history (for example, because they refer to a .yml file that no longer exists), then you will need to start from the list of installed packages in the old conda environment.\nTo do this, start by activating the old environment, and then export the package list to a file:\nconda env export \u0026gt; environment.yml You will use this file to create the new environment. But first, you should edit the file:\nIn the channels section, ensure that conda-forge is included and defaults is not.\nThen go through and simplify it as much as possible, so that it contains the list of necessary packages but does not constrain the environment too tightly, for reasons discussed above:\nRemove packages that you do not recognise; only include what you will use explicitly. Remember that any dependencies will get added for you automatically. This applies both to the list of conda packages and also any packages from PyPI if the file contains a pip: section. Relax the version numbers: definitely remove the exact release (after the second = sign), and also consider removing the package version number \u0026ndash; or possibly changing it to \u0026gt;= to permit also more recent versions. For example, change sqlite=3.41.2=h5eee18b_0 to just sqlite or sqlite\u0026gt;=3.41.2. Once you have done this, activate your miniforge base environment, and then use it create your new environment, for example:\nconda env create -n my_new_env -f environment.yml or using the mamba installer:\nmamba env create -n my_new_env -f environment.yml As above, remember to delete your old environment afterwards."

        content: "Creating a virtual environment is useful to allow a discrete set of extra packages to be installed to meet specific requirements. This allows a user to run multiple environments with different dependencies without conflicts.\nThere are a number of ways to create a virtual environment to use with the Notebooks Service. This document outlines the most common and recommended methods, and then some other ways which you might find useful.\nPlease note that environments created for the Notebooks Service will not work on the JASMIN scientific analysis servers or the LOTUS batch processing.\nStep 1: Creating a virtual environment \u0026nbsp; This step creates a Python virtual environment, and allows you to install packages into it.\n\u0026nbsp; These commands are intended for use at the Jupyter Notebooks shell, not on the JASMIN sci machines To get started, open the JASMIN Notebooks Service\u0026nbsp; and in the launcher click the terminal button.\nOpening the terminal \u0026nbsp; Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if you see this: this is a known issue but should not cause you a problem.\nid: cannot find name for user ID NNNNN [I have no name!@jupyter-user notebooks-misc]$ Then, type these commands at the bash shell which appears.\nFirst, make a directory in which to store your virtual environments. You can put this wherever you like, as long as you reference the same place later. You could store several virtual environments within this directory, for different purposes. Then, change into that directory.\nmkdir ~/nb_envs cd ~/nb_envs Next, create a new empty virtual environment. We recommended including the --system-site-packages argument which will allow you to add packages on top of jaspy, rather than starting completely from scratch.\npython -m venv name-of-environment --system-site-packages Then, activate the specific virtual environment created above, which will allow you to install packages.\nsource name-of-environment/bin/activate If you want to be able to use your virtual environment as a Jupyter Notebook kernel (recommended), you should install ipykernel using pip.\npip install ipykernel You can then install whatever packages you need in the environment.\npip install pyjokes If you change your mind and need to add more packages in the future, it is simple to activate the virtual environment in the same way as above and use pip to install more packages.\nStep 2: Making the notebooks service recognise your new kernel \u0026nbsp; These steps are also run from the notebooks\u0026rsquo; service shell, as above.\nIf you aren\u0026rsquo;t still there from the last step, cd to the location of your venv.\ncd ~/nb_envs If it isn\u0026rsquo;t already active, activate the virtual environment.\nsource name-of-environment/bin/activate Running the following command will make the Notebooks Service notice your new virtual environment, and include it in the list of kernels which you can run code with. You only have to do this once.\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name=name-of-environment Step 3: Using your new kernel \u0026nbsp; Select kernel, in this case: 'name-of-environment' You can then choose this kernel from the Jupyter Notebook homepage, or from the top right of any open notebook. No changes to the Python code within are required.\nKernel name shown in notebook title tab Other tips \u0026amp; useful knowledge \u0026nbsp; Activating an environment without it being a kernel \u0026nbsp; If you follow Step 1 above to create a virtual environment, it is possible to use the packages from this environment in a Python file without making it a kernel. While this can be useful, it has the very distinct disadvantage of hardcoding the path to your virtual environment in your Python code. For this reason we discourage using this method with a medium level of severity. To do this, simply add the following code to your Python file before any imports. Adjust the venv_path variable to be correct for the venv you created.\nimport sys import pathlib import platform venv_path = \u0026#34;~/nb_envs/name-of-environment\u0026#34; py_version = platform.python_version_tuple() sys.path.append( str( pathlib.Path( f\u0026#34;venv_path/lib/pythonpy_version[0].py_version[1]/site-packages/\u0026#34; ).expanduser() ) )Explanation: this adds the site-packages folder from your venv directly to the path Python uses to search for packages ($PYTHONPATH). This lets Python find them to import.\nCan I install packages from inside my Python code? \u0026nbsp; We very strongly recommend NOT trying to install Python packages from inside notebook code. pip isn\u0026rsquo;t designed for it, and it is almost always easier to activate the venv as above and install things that way.\nIf you wish to record the set of packages inside your venv so you can install them en-masse later, pip has the facility to do this. To export a list of packages that exist inside a venv, from the notebook\u0026rsquo;s bash shell with the virtual environment in question activated:\npip freeze \u0026gt; requirements.txt To install a list of packages which have been exported:\npip install -r requirements.txt Exporting packages in this way is also useful for sharing your environment with others, reinstalling when it breaks etc. It\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to keep the requirements file alongside the code in version control. If your code becomes more complex it is probably more sensible to make it a Python package, and install it as one, but doing that is outside the scope of this document.\nIf you really must, you can call pip from inside your notebook like this: (after first updating the packages variable to be the ones you want to install.)\nimport sys import subprocess as sp packages = [\u0026#39;pyjokes\u0026#39;] sp.check_call([sys.executable, \u0026#39;-m\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;pip\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;install\u0026#39;] + packages) Can I use conda instead of a virtual environment? \u0026nbsp; Yes, no problem.\nTo create a conda environment, simply run the following at the JASMIN Notebook shell:\nconda create --name name-insert-here ipykernel Install any packages you which to use in the environment:\nconda install --name name-insert-here pyjokes Make the Notebooks Service recognise your environment as a kernel:\nconda run --name name-insert-here python -m ipykernel install --user --name name-insert-here Can I get rid of my old kernels from the Notebooks Service? \u0026nbsp; Yes.\nTo list the names of kernels you have installed, run the following at the JASMIN Notebook shell:\njupyter kernelspec list To remove one of them, run:\njupyter kernelspec uninstall insert-name-here"

        description: "Creating and using miniforge environments",
        
        
        content: "On JASMIN, we provide a wide range of packages via the jaspy environment (which is itself a Conda environment). This page gives detail on how to create and use your own personal Conda environments via the miniforge installer, as an alternative to the use of Jaspy.\nTo decide which to use, please see this page: conda environments and python virtual environments.\nObtaining miniforge \u0026nbsp; In order to create your own conda environments, you will first need to download the miniforge\u0026nbsp; installer. This is a lightweight installer, and will also ensure that packages are downloaded from the conda-forge channel (important for licensing reasons). For this reason, it should be used in preference to either condaforge or Anaconda.\nMiniforge can be downloaded using:\nwget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh Deactivating Jaspy \u0026nbsp; You cannot have your own conda environment activated at the same time as Jaspy, so it is recommended that if you have loaded the jaspy module, then you start by typing:\nmodule unload jaspy Creating a base environment \u0026nbsp; You can run the installer by typing:\nbash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.shYou will be asked to confirm the licence agreement, to choose an installation location, and to decide whether it should run \u0026ldquo;conda init\u0026rdquo;. It is recommended that you:\nAccept the default location (~/miniforge3). If you need to change this, see the section \u0026ldquo;Varying the installation location\u0026rdquo; near the end of this page for more info. Say no to the question about conda init, because saying yes will cause it to add lines to your ~/.bashrc file causing your base environment to be activated every time you log in, which may interfere with the use of Jaspy. If you say no, you can still follow the instructions below when you wish to activate your base environment. (Add the -b option at the end of the above command to run the installer in batch mode, which will also skip the \u0026ldquo;conda init\u0026rdquo;. Or add -h to see help on other available command-line options.)\nActivating the base environment \u0026nbsp; Assuming that you made the choices recommended above when running the installer, you should type the following in order to activate the base environment:\nsource ~/miniforge3/bin/activate(You may encounter documentation elsewhere which suggests conda activate instead, but the above command is a workaround for the fact that you have not run conda init, the reasons for which are explained above.)\nYour command prompt will then change to include (base) at the start, in order to remind you that this environment is activated. You can deactivate the environment by typing:\nconda deactivate Creating and activating a sub-environment \u0026nbsp; Although once you have activated the base miniforge environment, you can in principle start to install packages immediately, your use of miniforge will generally be better organised if you do not install packages directly into the base environment, but instead use a named sub-environment. You can have multiple sub-environments under a single base environment, and activate the one that is required at any one time. These sub-environments will work independently.\nMiniforge provides two installer programs: conda and mamba. These use different algorithms, and mamba is implemented in C++ while conda is implemented in Python. Both commands work with the same type of environments, here referred to as \u0026ldquo;conda environments\u0026rdquo;, but in our experience from preparing the Jaspy environments, mamba is faster than conda and uses less memory. Therefore, our recommendation is to use mamba for installing environments. However, if you are not running mamba init, then you will need to use the conda command when activating or deactivating environments. The commands shown on this page reflect this, but if you prefer, you can use conda throughout. Also, for some of the commands not involving package installation, e.g. when listing environments, the two commands can be used interchangeably, although the mamba command is shown on this help page.\nTo create a named environment (for example, called myenv), ensure that the base environment is activated (the command prompt should start with (base)), and type:\nmamba create -n myenvIt will show the proposed installation location, and once you answer the prompt to proceed, will do the installation. If you have followed these instructions, this location should be /home/users/\u0026lt;your_username\u0026gt;/miniforge3/envs/myenv. You can alternatively give it a different location using the option -p \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; instead of -n \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.\nOnce you have created your sub-environment, you can activate it using conda activate \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; for example:\nconda activate myenvalthough you can also activate it using its full path, useful if you used the -p option to specify a non-standard path for the environment, for example:\nconda activate /gws/smf/j04/mygws/myenvThe command prompt will then change (e.g. to start with (myenv) ) to reflect this. Typing conda deactivate once will return you to the base environment; typing it a second time will deactivate conda completely (as above).\nmamba env listwill list your environments.\nInstalling conda packages \u0026nbsp; Once you have activated a named environment, you can install packages with the mamba install command, for example:\nmamba install gccYou can also force particular versions to be installed. For example:\nmamba install gcc=13.2.0 # exact version mamba install \u0026#34;gcc\u0026gt;=13.2.0\u0026#34; # greater than or equal to mamba install \u0026#34;gcc\u0026gt;=13.2.0,\u0026lt;14\u0026#34; # AND(Here, quotation marks are needed to protect the \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; symbols from the shell.)\nYou can also search for available versions, using for example:\nmamba search gccTo list the packages installed in the currently activated environment, you can type mamba list. This should normally indicate that all packages are from the conda-forge channel. You can install from a channel other than conda-forge by using the -c option, for example:\nmamba install -c ncas cf-python # install cf-python from \u0026#39;ncas\u0026#39; channelbut for licensing reasons, do not use the Anaconda defaults channel.\nRunning packages from your conda environment \u0026nbsp; In order to run packages from a conda environment that you installed previously, you will first need to activate the environment in the session that you are using. This means repeating some of the commands typed above. Of course, you will not need to repeat the steps to create the environment or install the software, but the following may be needed again:\nmodule unload jaspy source ~/miniforge3/bin/activate conda activate myenv Installing pip packages \u0026nbsp; Many python packages that are available via PyPI are also available as conda packages in conda-forge, and it is generally best to use these via mamba install as above.\nNonetheless, you can also install pip packages (as opposed to conda packages) into your conda environment. However, first you should type:\nmamba install pipbefore typing the desired commands such as\npip install numpyIf you do not install pip into your sub-environment, then either:\nyour shell will fail to find the pip executable, or your shell will find pip in some other location, which might lead to pip packages being installed in an unexpected location, possibly resulting in interference between your environments Explicitly installing pip into your sub-environment will guard against this.\nBefore running pip install, you could check that pip is being run from the correct place, by typing:\nwhich pipand it should report something like:\n~/miniforge3/envs/myenv/bin/pip Cloning a conda environment \u0026nbsp; There can be occasions when you wish to create a conda environment which is based on the contents of an existing environment. An example when you might wish to do this is in order to create an environment of your own which is based on Jaspy but with certain changes such as the addition or removal of certain packages. (Recall that your environment cannot be activated at the same time as Jaspy.)\nTo do this, you can export a list of packages to a YAML file and use this file to create the new environment \u0026ndash; as follows:\nfirst activate the conda environment that you wish to clone (for Jaspy, load the jaspy module) export a list of contents to a YAML file (for example environment.yml) by typing mamba env export \u0026gt; environment.yml deactivate this environment (or as the case may be, unload the jaspy module) ensure that the relevant base environment is activated create the new environment (for example my_new_env) by using: mamba env create -n my_new_env -f environment.ymlNote the use of mamba env create, rather than mamba create as above.\nYou might also edit the YAML file before using it to create the environment if you do not want an exact clone \u0026ndash; for example, adding packages, removing packages that are not of relevance, or removing version requirements in order to give mamba more flexibility about what versions to install (for example if you do not require particular legacy versions, or if the versions in the original environment are no longer available).\nVarying the installation location \u0026nbsp; (This is the section that is referred to above, where running the Miniforge installer is discussed.)\nThe default installation location offered by the installer for your base environment will be ~/miniforge3 (that is, a miniforge3 subdirectory of your home directory). We recommend accepting this default, or using another location under your home directory. It is possible to change this, but note that a conda environment can have tens of thousands of files and that group workspaces on JASMIN will generally perform poorly for this use case. If you need to make a conda environment which is shared with collaborators, you may need to request a small files GWS as these will give better performance.\nIf you are creating a conda environment for very short-term testing only, you may find best performance using /tmp due to the large number of files. However, you may need several gigabytes, which is too big for the /tmp areas on most of the sci machines at time of writing, although the physical sci machines (currently sci-ph-01 and sci-ph-02 for Rocky 9) have larger /tmp areas. Choose an appropriate machine, make use of the df command to check available disk space, and ensure that you do not fill up /tmp as this would impact negatively on other users."

        content: "Introduction \u0026nbsp; Dask Gateway\u0026nbsp; is a service which manages Dask\u0026nbsp; clusters for users. On JASMIN, it creates a Dask cluster in LOTUS, our batch computing cluster. It automatically creates a Dask for you, scheduling Slurm jobs to create Dask schedulers and workers as appropriate.\nPrerequisites \u0026nbsp; Before using Dask Gateway on JASMIN, you will need:\nAn existing JASMIN account and valid jasmin-login access role: Apply here\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Subsequently (once jasmin-login has been approved and completed), the dask access role: Apply here\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; The jasmin-login access role ensures that your account is set up with access to the LOTUS batch processing cluster, while the dask role grants access to the special LOTUS partition used by the Dask Gateway service.\nCreating a Dask cluster \u0026nbsp; In the JASMIN Notebooks service \u0026nbsp; In the JASMIN notebooks service\u0026nbsp; , authentication to dask-gateway happens automatically. You can use the snippet below to create a cluster and get a Dask client which you can use:\nimport dask_gateway # Create a connection to dask-gateway. gw = dask_gateway.Gateway(\u0026#34;https://dask-gateway.jasmin.ac.uk\u0026#34;, auth=\u0026#34;jupyterhub\u0026#34;) # Inspect and change the options if required before creating your cluster. options = gw.cluster_options() options.worker_cores = 2 # Create a Dask cluster, or, if one already exists, connect to it. # This stage creates the scheduler job in Slurm, so it may take some # time while your job queues. clusters = gw.list_clusters() if not clusters: cluster = gw.new_cluster(options, shutdown_on_close=False) else: cluster = gw.connect(clusters[0].name) # Create at least one worker, and allow your cluster to scale to three. cluster.adapt(minimum=1, maximum=3) # Get a Dask client. client = cluster.get_client() ######################### ### DO DASK WORK HERE ### ######################### # When you are done and wish to release your cluster: cluster.shutdown() Elsewhere on JASMIN \u0026nbsp; The following explains how to use the Dask Gateway elsewhere on JASMIN, for example, on the sci machines.\n\u0026nbsp; It is not necessary to do this if you only want to use Dask in the JASMIN notebook service. At the current time, it is still necessary to use the notebooks service to generate an API token to allow you to connect to the gateway server.\n\u0026nbsp; It is very important that your API token is not shared between users and remains secret. With it, another user could submit Dask jobs to LOTUS as you, and they could exploit this to see anything in your JASMIN account. Setup \u0026nbsp; Make a Dask configuration folder in your home directory\nmkdir -p ~/.config/dask Create a configuration file for dask-gateway\ntouch ~/.config/dask/gateway.yaml Change the permissions on the file so that only you can read it\nchmod 600 ~/.config/dask/gateway.yaml Head to the API token generator page\u0026nbsp; , put a note in the box to remind yourself what this token is for, press the big orange button, then copy the token.\nPaste the following snippet into ~/.config/dask/gateway.yaml, replace the entry on the final line with the API token you just created.\ngateway: address: https://dask-gateway.jasmin.ac.uk auth: type: jupyterhub kwargs: api_token: replaceWithYourSecretAPIToken You\u0026rsquo;re done. You can now use dask-gateway from the command line.\nAccess the Dask dashboard \u0026nbsp; To get the link to your Dask dashboard, run the following:\nprint(client.dashboard_link)Currently the Dask dashboard is not accessible from a browser outside the JASMIN firewall. If your browser fails to load the dashboard link returned, please use our graphical desktop service to run a Firefox browser inside the firewall to view your dashboard.\nUse a custom Python environment \u0026nbsp; By default the JASMIN Notebooks service and Dask Gateway use the latest version of the jaspy software environment. However, often users would like to use their own software environments.\nUnderstanding the problem \u0026nbsp; When Dask Gateway creates a dask cluster for a user, it runs a setup command to activate a conda environment or python venv. To have Dask use your packages, you need to create a custom environment which you can pass to dask-gateway to activate.\nHowever, for technical reasons, it is not currently possible to use the same virtual environment in both the notebook service and on JASMIN. So you will need to make two environments, one for your notebook to use and one for Dask to use.\n\u0026nbsp; It is VERY important that these environments have the same packages installed in them, and that the packages are exactly the same version in both environments.\nIf you do not keep packages and versions in-sync you can expect many confusing errors.\nIf you use a self-contained conda environment this is not a problem, and you can use this as a kernel in the notebooks service and on the sci machines. You can skip to Putting it all together below.\nCreating a virtual environment for Dask \u0026nbsp; Login to one of the JASMIN sci machines. Activate jaspy module load jaspy Create your environment in the normal way python -m venv name-of-environment Activate the environment source name-of-environment/bin/activate Install dask and dask gateway and dependencies: without this step your environment will not work with dask. pip install dask-gateway dask lz4 Creating a virtual environment for the notebooks service \u0026nbsp; Follow the instructions here to create a virtual environment. Install Dask and Dask Gateway and dependencies: without this step your environment will not work with Dask. pip install dask-gateway dask lz4 Putting it all together \u0026nbsp; Set your notebook virtual environment as the kernel for the notebook in question as shown in the instructions linked above. Set options.worker_setup to a command which will activate your Dask virtual environment. For example options.worker_setup = \u0026#34;source /home/users/example/name-of-environment/bin/activate\u0026#34; If you have an existing Dask cluster, close it and ensure all LOTUS jobs are stopped before recreating it using the new environment. Code Examples \u0026nbsp; Examples of code and notebooks which can be used to test the JASMIN Dask Gateway service are available on GitHub\u0026nbsp; ."

        description: "Overview of data transfer",
        
        
        content: "This article introduces the topic of data transfer to/from JASMIN.\nIntroduction to Data Transfer on JASMIN \u0026nbsp; As a JASMIN user you are very likely to be involved in data transfer. You might need to copy data files/directories from JASMIN to remote sites (such as your own PC, MONSooN or ARCHER2) or bring new data on to JASMIN. These data transfer articles explain how to use the basic transfer tools such as rsync and scp as well as more sophisticated services such as Globus. They also cover which transfer services and servers are available to JASMIN users.\nFor many users, moving small amounts of data over short distances, the basic tools will meet their requirements. However, data transfer is a complicated topic so we also provide articles about how you can improve your transfer rates to make the most of the available bandwidth. We include details about transfers over connections to specific sites (such as the Met Office). Advice is also provided about automating and scheduling data transfers, along with tips for different transfer workflows.\nTransfers to/from JASMIN \u0026nbsp; 1. Transfers initiated from JASMIN \u0026nbsp; When initiating a transfer from a transfer server on JASMIN you would usually start by logging on to the server (via SSH). Once you are logged in you can initiate a connection to the outside world in order to push/pull the data you require.\n2. Transfers initiated from elsewhere \u0026nbsp; When initiating a transfer from elsewhere you will transfer data files to/from a source machine (which may be inside or outside JASMIN) to the transfer server.\nTransfer directories \u0026nbsp; You will typically transfer data to/from a Group Workspace that you have been granted access to. If you are copying data from JASMIN you might want to copy data from the CEDA archive (mounted on JASMIN) to a remote site. You might also wish to copy small volumes of data to/from your $HOME directory. All of these locations are available on the transfer servers.\nJASMIN Transfer servers \u0026nbsp; JASMIN provides specific serversservers for managing data transfers. Please read about the different servers available for particular data transfer needs, and about the various data transfer tools available.\nImproving your transfer rates \u0026nbsp; To achieve better transfer rates, for large transfers or where speed and reliability are important, you are recommended to:\nuse the Globus data transfer service (recommended as the best method), or use the high-performance data transfer servers (physical equivalents of the transfer VMs, located in a special network zone) use other parallel-capable transfer tools such as bbcp, lftp (parallel-capable ftp client), or gridftp: see Data transfer tools Transfer rates depend on many factors, so try to consider all of these:\ndo you really need to transfer some/all of the data? is the data in the CEDA Archive already (don\u0026rsquo;t copy it, if so, just process it in-place!) can your workflow deal with processing just smaller \u0026ldquo;chunks\u0026rdquo; at a time (streaming)? do you really need to have/keep all the source data, if it\u0026rsquo;s stored somewhere else? the network path all the way from where the source data resides, to the destination file system high-performance data transfer tools are great, but is the \u0026ldquo;last mile\u0026rdquo; over WiFi to your laptop? what is the length of the network path? If it\u0026rsquo;s international or intercontinental, SSH-based methods won\u0026rsquo;t work well. Consider Globus. the host at each end what sort of host is it (laptop, departmental server, virtual machine, physical machine) and what is its network connectivity? the file systems at each end not all file systems perform the same, for given types of data or transfer methods the size and number of files involved large numbers of small files can take a long time to transfer are the data in deep directory trees? These can take a long time to recreate on the destination file system consider creating a tar/zip archive to transfer fewer but larger files, or at least a method that copes well with many files in parallel or \u0026ldquo;in flight\u0026rdquo; at once. checking data integrity some methods will verify data integrity at source and destination to ensure integrity. This can be resource-heavy and slow. time of day would scheduling your transfer to happen at quieter times, mean that it completes more efficiently and/or without impacting others? Consider source and destination time zones!"

Includes capability to schedule, repeat and orchestrate transfers between third-party hosts and receive notifications of job status. Has web and command-line interfaces. Efficient for moving large volumes and/or numbers of files, especially over long distances. scp A basic transfer tool that works over the SSH protocol. Similar to \u0026ldquo;cp\u0026rdquo; but copies between remote servers. rsync (over SSH) Like scp but more sophisticated. Allows synchronisation between remote directory trees. sftp SSH FTP - works over SSH. bbcp A command-line tool that allows the user to specify parallel transfer over multiple streams, using SSH authentication. GridFTP (over SSH) An old but comprehensive data transfer tool. Highly configurable and able to transfer over multiple parallel streams. Used over SSH in this case. Superseded by Globus FTP File Transfer Protocol. An aged transfer protocol suitable for small file transfers but limited. LFTP Parallel-capable FTP client. wget, curl Download tools for accessing resources over HTTP primarily. (see 3rd party documentation) sharing GWS data via http for exposing part(s) of a Group Workspace via HTTP to users without JASMIN accounts. Python transfer tools Methods of managing/scripting data transfer tasks using Python. You can use libraries such as requests in a Python 3 virtual environment on the transfer servers. MASS client (Met Office) A specific command-line tool installed on the mass-cli1.ceda.ac.uk server on JASMIN. Enables extractions from the Met Office MASS Archive. OPeNDAP A transfer protocol for extracting subsets of files from a remote server (over HTTP) rclone A 3rd party, open-source command-line utility which can interface to, and synchronise data between, a wide variety of cloud and other storage backends, such as Google Drive and AWS S3 compatible object stores. It can also sync data over SSH. This utility is not installed on JASMIN but is well-documented and trivial for users to download and configure themselves on one of the data transfer servers Please note install instructions, and dos and don\u0026rsquo;tsfor rclone on JASMIN."

Please see the MOOSE User Guide here Will my account expire? Yes. By default, MASS via JASMIN accounts will expire after 500 days and your account will be automatically disabled.\nShortly before your account is due to expire you will receive an email, and it will contain instructions for you and your sponsor about how to extend your access. If your account has already expired and you are looking to reactive it, please email: Monsoon@metoffice.gov.uk\nWhy am I asked for a password when logging in to mass-cli? There are two reasons that may result in you being prompted for a password when attempting to login to the MASS client machine (mass-cli.jasmin.ac.uk).\nThe first is if you do not have permission to access the machine. A quick method to check is to verify if you are a member of the moose user group. It should be listed when you use the ‘groups’ command:\n[login1]$ groups mooseIf this happens, please contact: Monsoon@metoffice.gov.uk\nThe second is if you forget the -A option for agent forwarind when you ssh to a JASMIN login node. You can test for this condition by listing loaded identities on the login node, and finding you have none:\n[login1]$ ssh-add -l Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.If this happens, please exit back to your local machine and ssh in again using the -A flag or tick the relevant box for \u0026ldquo;agent forwarding\u0026rdquo;.\nHow can I directly login to the MASS client machine? You can\u0026rsquo;t, but you can edit your ssh configuration so that it automatically enables you to jump through the intermediary login servers.\nAdd the following to your home institute ssh config file ($HOME/.ssh/config file):\nHost mass-cli User your_jasmin_userid HostName mass-cli.jasmin.ac.uk ProxyCommand ssh -YA -t your_jasmin_userid@login1.jasmin.ac.uk -W %h:%p 2\u0026gt;/dev/nullYou should then be able to login directly using:\n$ ssh mass-cliPlease note that this only works if you are using OpenSSH version 5.4 or greater as earlier versions do not support the -W flag. You can check your version using: ssh -v\nCan I write to MASS from JASMIN? No, MASS access from JASMIN is strictly read-only. If you need to write to the MASS archive, contact monsoon@metoffice.gov.uk and ask to be put in touch with the relevant team. MOOSE messages and what to do \u0026nbsp; Is this process running in the correct environment? When running \u0026lsquo;moo install\u0026rsquo; you may get an error message similar to:\nCannot read file: /home/user/\u0026lt;userid\u0026gt;/.moosedir/moose - is this process running in the correct environment?This can be the result of the wrong combination of Unix user-id and UID having been used to encrypt the credentials file. If you encounter this error message, please type id on the command line whilst logged into JASMIN, and send the uid= section of the output to: Monsoon@metoffice.gov.uk\nYour credentials file will then be reissued.\nYour password is due to expire in X day(s). Occasionally on running a MOOSE command you will be told that your password is due to expire with a message of the form:\nYour password is due to expire in 6 day(s). A new password can be generated using 'moo passwd -r'. This refers specifically to your MASS via JASMIN, it does not affect any other MOOSE accounts you may have.\nYou need to run the command as advised in order to update your credentials whilst you are logged into mass-cli. You do not actually need to provide a new password, as this is generated and hidden from you by the command.\nIf you have a retrieval in progress, it is safe to run this command as it will not affect processes already running.\nERROR_SINGLE_COPY_UNAVAILABLE MOOSE - Single Copy Unavailable error\nOn occasion, a tape library needs to be taken down for maintenance. If a user is trying to retrieve a single-copy file stored on one of those tapes, the retrieval will temporarily fail with the message ERROR_SINGLE_COPY_UNAVAILABLE. As soon as the maintenance is completed, the file will be available again.\nTapes are taken out of MASS for copying to the new MASS system and become unavailable for roughly 14 days. The process is as follows:\nThursday (week one): Tapes are marked unavailable for indexing by the system. Tuesday (week two): Tapes get taken out for copying to the new MASS system. Following Thursday (week three): Tapes are returned to Met Office library and should be available again. So, if you find that data or files are unavailable due to the ERROR_SINGLE_COPY_UNAVAILABLE error, try reading the data again on Friday, and if still not available, try the following Friday when the migration should have completed.\nMOOSE basics \u0026nbsp; What is MOOSE? The software that allows you to interact with MASS. What is a project? A collection of access rules. What is an access rule? Permission to access an area in MASS. For example, project-random might have an access rule to moose:/crum/random-numbers\nBeing part of project-random would allow you to access the random-numbers set.\nHow do I see what projects I am a member of? You can use: moo prls How do I see what access rules a project has? You can use: moo projinfo -l projectname (Replace projectname with the name of one of your projects) How do I get access to a project, or add an access rule to one of my projects? Please contact your sponsor. They can then complete this form if they also agree you require access:\nhttps://metoffice.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item\u0026sys_id=5653331e1bbaf0d88ffa422ad34bcba0\u0026referrer=recent_items\u0026nbsp; Please note that the link above is only visible to those in the Met Office.\nWhy can I not access a set that I know is part of a project? If you are given access to a project but do not have access to all the sets associated with it, this can be due to the Access Control Lists (ACLs).\nThe project owner will be able to change the ACLs on sets to make them readable if it is appropriate.\nHow do I retrieve a file from MASS? Use moo get or moo select. More information about both commands is in the MOOSE User Guide. How do I make sure my directory has all the available data retrieved from MASS? The problem: You are running a model over a period of several days or weeks, and you need to analyse the output of the model as it runs. You have a moo get or moo select command that you run to fetch the data that is available. You want to be able to re-run it to fetch the files or fields that have been added to MASS since you last ran the command, but you do not want it to waste time re-fetching things you already have.\nThe solution: Use the -i or \u0026ndash;fill-gaps option when you run moo get or moo select. This option tells MOOSE that you only want to fetch files that don\u0026rsquo;t already exist in the specified local directory. Note that MASS works out where gaps are by doing checks to see if files of the expected name exist in your destination directory, so it won\u0026rsquo;t behave correctly if you rename files after you have retrieved them, or if you use the -C option with moo select which condenses all the matching fields into a single file.\nYou might also find the -g / --get-if-available option to moo get useful. This tells MOOSE to get every file from your moo get list that is available, but ignore ones that are not there rather than exit with an error. This could help if you are expecting files to be archived at some point but are not sure whether they will be there when your job runs. If you use this option MOOSE will get as much as it can from your list without bailing out.\nHow can I script my data retrieval from MASS? There are restrictions on how to login to JASMIN and use of Linux utilities such as ‘cron’ and ‘at’ but it is possible to remotely initiate a retrieval from MASS on to JASMIN, provided you have your ssh agent running on a machine local to you.\neval $(ssh-agent -s) ssh-add ~/.ssh/jasmin_id_rsa ssh -A -X sci1.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026#39;ssh mass-cli my_script.sh\u0026#39;If you have set up your $HOME/.ssh/config to allow more direct access, then the following should work:\nssh mass-cli my_script.shThis will run the script “my_script.sh” on the MASS client VM. You can put the moose retrieval commands into a script and it should work:\n#!/bin/bash SRC_URI=moose:/opfc/atm/global/SOMETHING moo get $SRC_URI jasmin_copy.pp exitIf you have access to an appropriate JASMIN workspace, then you can scp data from the workspace directly through one of the dedicated data transfer VMs. Again, you need the ssh-agent running locally:\neval $(ssh-agent -s) ssh-add ~/.ssh/jasmin_id_rsa scp userid@xfer-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk:/group_workspaces/cems/\u0026lt;project\u0026gt;/jasmin_file.pp my_local_copy.pp Can I run MASS retrievals on LOTUS or through a workload manager? In addition to the interactive mass-cli server there is also the moose1 server that is only accessible through the\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;/test-decap-help/docs/batch-computing/lotus-overview/\u0026quot;\u0026gt;LOTUS batch processing cluster\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. To submit jobs to moose1 you must use the [Slurm scheduler](https://mjpritchard.github.io/test-decap-help/docs/batch-computing/slurm-scheduler-overview/). You will need to specify the account mass and partition mass, for example:\nsbatch -A mass -p mass [\u0026lt;options\u0026gt;] \u0026lt;jobscript\u0026gt;where \u0026lt;jobscript\u0026gt; looks something like:\n#!/bin/bash SRC_URI=moose:/opfc/atm/global/SOMETHING moo get $SRC_URI jasmin_copy.pp exitIt is also easy to configure the Rose/Cylc workflow manager to submit jobs to moose1 through the Slurm scheduler by including the following lines in your suite.rc file:\n[[[job submission]]] method = slurm [[[directives]]] --partition=mass --account=mass [\u0026lt;options\u0026gt;]"

        content: "This article provides information about FTP (File Transfer Protocol) as a data transfer tool. In particular:\nwhat is FTP? where and how can I use FTP on JASMIN? what are its limitations? What is FTP? \u0026nbsp; FTP\u0026nbsp; is a well-established transfer protocol enabling connections from a client to download files from, or upload files to, a server, although limited in security. A wide variety of client tools are available to the user, 2 implementations of which are available on the JASMIN transfer servers, although no server is provided. ftp is also the name of the basic FTP client program, see below.\nWhere and how can I use FTP on JASMIN? \u0026nbsp; FTP can only be used as a client on JASMIN, to pull data from external FTP servers to local storage on JASMIN, for example a Group Workspace or your home directory. There is no FTP server within JASMIN providing the ability to upload files to these locations. Please use an alternative, more secure method instead. See other Data Transfer Tools such as scp/rsync/sftp, bbcp or GridFTP ( over SSH or using Globus)\nOn the transfer servers, you can use one of the installed FTP clients to download data from elsewhere. These are:\nftp basic ftp client. Usage details lftp parallel-capable ftp client. Usage details CEDA however runs 2 FTP servers within the JASMIN environment providing download-only access to the CEDA archive. Access to these is controlled by your CEDA account and any dataset-specific privileges which are associated with that account.\nWhat are its limitations? \u0026nbsp; FTP was never designed as a secure protocol and has several limitations\u0026nbsp; affecting how it can be used safely within an environment like JASMIN. Some external sites offer anonymous FTP download. In this case, no username or password needs to be exchanged and (as long as the data resources do not need to be protected in any way) this can provide a simple but effective data transfer method. Few external sites now provide FTP access to protected data resources, hence many data-intensive institutions are now focussing on more sophisticated data delivery methods which can meet the demands of security and performance in a multi-user environment. Basic client usage: ftp \u0026nbsp; The ftp client is available on the transfer servers xfer*.jasmin.ac.uk and high-performance transfer servers hpxfer*.jasmin.ac.uk.\nExample 1: Downloading a file to a location on JASMIN from a remote FTP server.\nThis involves setting up an interactive client session. Once logged in (in this case, using anonymous FTP), you use FTP commands to interact with the remote server and locate and download the data you require. The session is terminated with bye.\nftp someserver.somesite.ac.uk Trying 123.456.78.123... Connected to someserver.somesite.ac.uk (123.456.78.123). 220---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 220-Welcome message from somesite.ac.uk 220---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 220 Name (123.456.78.123:username): anonymous 331 Please specify the password.

Full details of commands available within an interactive session with the ftp client are available via the man page (man ftp).\nParallel-capable client usage: lftp \u0026nbsp; The alternative client lftp is less verbose, but the basic workflow is the same.\nlftp someserver.somesite.ac.uk Once connected, the prompt changes to lftp and the name of the remote server:\ncd /sites/pub/testdir cd ok, cwd=/sites/pub/testdir/ get md5.sum 45 bytes transferred bye The interactive shell provided by lftp also benefits from tab completion and use of up/down arrows for command history.\nIn fact, lftp can also be used as an SFTP client, with the added benefit that it can handle multiple SFTP transfers in parallel.\nIn the following example, we connect to a remote SFTP server using the sftp:// syntax. Once logged in to the remote server, the prompt changes and you can enter lftp-specific commands like mirror, in this case with -P 4 as the option to use 4 sftp processes in parallel. Try other values but please consider other users so a suggested limit is 16.\nlftp sftp://username@someserver.somesite.ac.uk Password: (enter password when prompted) mirror -P 4 sourcedata bye Note that if you\u0026rsquo;re connecting to a JASMIN transfer server in this way, then you would need to make your JASMIN private key available in an ssh agent locally, and you would not be prompted for the password."

        description: "Generate an SSH key pair",
        
        
        content: "This article explains how to create an SSH key pair for logging in to JASMIN.\nYou can also use this procedure to update an existing SSH key pair for JASMIN. However, if you are experiencing problems logging in to JASMIN you are advised to first check Login problems before changing your key. Once you have created your SSH key pair, the public key will need to be uploaded to your JASMIN profile\u0026nbsp; . If this is the first time you have created a key pair then this will be done when you create an account on the accounts portal (Step 2 of Get Started with JASMIN).\nSSH client and terminal \u0026nbsp; Generating an SSH key pair requires an SSH client, usually an application which functions as a terminal: a text-based environment where you type commands to make things happen. Linux and Mac users can use a standard terminal which is very likely to have SSH installed. Windows users are advised to find a suitable SSH client to use or install on their machine. Suggestions are:\nMobaXterm (requires license), provides a Linux-style terminal with all the relevant command-line and some GUI utilities included. Figures 1 and 2, below, show example terminal windows on a Mac, and Windows (using MobaXterm). Windows OpenSSH client\u0026nbsp; an optional feature in Windows 10 or 11, but usually installed by default. PuTTY\u0026nbsp; set of SSH tools (includes PuTTYgen GUI tool for generating keys, and Pageant ssh-agent) There are many more, but if you stick to one of these three, which are known to us, then potentially we can help you if you run into difficulties.\nMac terminal Terminal using Mobaxterm client on Windows Using ssh-keygen to create an SSH key pair \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; As of November 2024 you are now recommended to use an ECDSA key (instead of RSA), for better compatibility with some services. Please note the updated command and filenames generated. The Linux command ssh-keygen should be used to generate your SSH key pair. Open a terminal and generate your public and private key, as follows, replacing the e-mail address with your own:\nssh-keygen -m PEM -t ecdsa -b 521 -C \u0026#34;me@somewhere.ac.uk\u0026#34; -f ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin (Here, ~/ or $HOME both mean \u0026ldquo;your home directory\u0026rdquo;. The equivalent on Windows is %USERPROFILE%)\nThe equivalent using the graphical PuTTYgen or MobaKeyGen tools is with these settings: choose these before clicking \u0026ldquo;Generate\u0026rdquo; Settings for ECDSA key in PuTTYgen (same for MobaKeyGen). Choose settings before clicking Generate. When prompted, type a secure passphrase to protect your SSH private key. This is a requirement for access to JASMIN machines. Use a new, different passphrase whenever you generate a new key. Note that nothing is echoed to the screen when you enter your passphrase, so it may look like it is not working.\nThe output from the command-line tools will look something like this: Generating public/private ecdsa key pair. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): \u0026lt;ADD PASSPHRASE HERE\u0026gt; Enter same passphrase again: \u0026lt;REPEAT PASSPHRASE HERE\u0026gt; Your identification has been saved in /home/users/meuser/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin. Your public key has been saved in /home/users/meuser/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin.pub. The key fingerprint is: 74:14:95:8a:31:73:cc:5c:af:be:91:04:01:c2:39:0b me@somewhere.ac.uk Running ssh-keygen will generate two files in your $HOME/.ssh/ directory:\nid_ecdsa_jasmin - private key file (which should have permission \u0026ldquo;600\u0026rdquo;, i.e. read/write only by you) id_ecdsa_jasmin.pub - public key file The public key file is the part that you need to share in order to access JASMIN. Windows may mistakenly associated the *.pub file with Microsoft Publisher so don\u0026rsquo;t try to double-click it. When you need to copy \u0026amp; paste its contents to upload to your JASMIN profile, use a simple text editor (like Notepad).\nMake sure the file is stored in a directory called .ssh in your home directory (~/.ssh, $HOME/.ssh or %USERPROFILE%\\.ssh on Windows, or $env:UserProfile\\.ssh in PowerShell). Storing it elsewhere sometimes causes problems with permissions, but it\u0026rsquo;s also good to keep keys in one place so that they can be kept securely.\n\u0026nbsp; The private key file should be protected and not shared with others. It should stay on your local machine: Do not copy your private key to anywhere on JASMIN."

Once you\u0026rsquo;re up \u0026amp; running after following the steps below, we recommend new users to try the accompanying exercises. Table 1. Steps involved to gain login access to JASMIN.\nEssential steps \u0026nbsp; Step Details Comments 1 Generate an SSH key Create this on your laptop/desktop, ready to upload the public part of it to your JASMIN account. 2 Get a JASMIN portal account Register for an account: do this on the JASMIN Accounts Portal\u0026nbsp; . However, this simply creates a user profile to store your basic information and SSH key: it does not give you privileges to access any services yet: you will need to apply for access to the services you require, see below. 3 Request \u0026ldquo;jasmin-login\u0026rdquo; access Apply for the jasmin-login service, which will create you a system account and allow you to connect to it using SSH . 4 How to login Follow these steps for logging in to JASMIN via SSH . Optional further steps \u0026nbsp; Step Details Comments 5 Apply for access to additional services on JASMIN\n(optional) JASMIN has a range of additional services, access to which is managed via the Accounts Portal.

        content: "\u0026nbsp; Updated for new JASMIN Default Collection (replaces previous JASMIN Globus Endpoint) Please read Globus transfers with JASMIN first for a wider introduction to Globus on JASMIN.\nThis article describes\nhow to transfer data using the Globus Command Line Interface. It covers: how an end-user can set up their host (laptop, desktop or home directory on their departmental server) with the Globus Command-Line Interface (CLI) examples of common tasks using the CLI It is not necessary to use the Globus CLI on a JASMIN server: it is a tool that you can use anywhere (for example your own desktop/laptop) to interact with the Globus service, to orchestrate a transfer between 2 endpoints (collections, in new Globus terminology). The CLI is not centrally installed on JASMIN, and does not need to be in the same place as either of the 2 collections involved in the transfer. You could use the CLI on your own laptop/desktop, even if the 2 collections were 2 institutional Globus collections on opposite sides of the world. You could of course decide to install the CLI in your home directory on JASMIN if that were useful as part of your processing/data transfer workflow.\nThe Globus CLI is fully documented here\u0026nbsp; with examples\u0026nbsp; . It provides a command-line interface for managed transfers via the Globus cloud-based transfer service, which usually achieves the best possible transfer rate over a given route compared to other methods. Typically this will be significantly faster than can be achieved over scp, rsync or sftp transfers, particularly if the physical network path is long.\nThe Globus CLI is designed for use either interactively within an interactive shell or in scripts. An alternative Python software development kit (SDK)\u0026nbsp; is also available and should be considered for more sophisticated workflows.\nAlternatively, the Globus web interface at https://app.globus.org\u0026nbsp; can be used as an easy-to-use interface to orchestrate transfers interactively.\nWhichever method is used: CLI, SDK or web interface, transfers are invoked as asynchronous, managed tasks which can then be monitored, and if need be set to retry automatically until some pre-set deadline.\nPrerequisites \u0026nbsp; Linux environment with normal user privileges, or Mac environment with ability to install applications, or Windows environment with ability to install applications Python environment for that platform, with ability to create virtual environments (to enable installation of additional packages) For use of the JASMIN Default Collection: An active JASMIN user account, with “jasmin-login” role You may also wish to set up your own Globus endpoint using Globus Connect Personal, though this is not needed for these examples. Initial Setup \u0026nbsp; Get a Globus identity \u0026nbsp; Go to https://app.globus.org\u0026nbsp; and either:\nchoose one of the listed identity providers (e.g. GitHub, Google, \u0026hellip;) follow the link at the bottom to \u0026ldquo;use Globus ID to sign in\u0026rdquo; See also https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/\u0026nbsp; Set up the Globus CLI on your machine \u0026nbsp; Do the following on your own (local) machine. Make a Python virtual environment and activate it:\npython3 -m venv ./venv source ./venv/bin/activate Download the Globus CLI and install it into the virtual environment ( venv).\npip install globus-cli Try the globus login command. The first time you run this, you will be prompted to authorise the Globus CLI to carry out operations on behalf of your Globus ID. The URL will open in your default browser, where you should authenticate with your Globus ID credentials. If you prefer, you can copy/paste the URL from the command-line to a browser of your choice. Either way, you then need to click \u0026ldquo;Allow\u0026rdquo; in the browser window, then copy/paste the resulting \u0026ldquo;Native App Authorization Code\u0026rdquo; back to the terminal window where you issued the globus login command:\nglobus login --no-local-server Please authenticate with Globus here: ------------------------------------ https://auth.globus.org/v2/oauth2/authorize?client_id=abc1234-9c3c-4ad42-be31-8d6c87101239014\u0026amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fauth.globus.org%2Fv2%2Fweb%2Fauth-code\u0026amp;scope=openid+profile+email+urn%3Aglobus%3Aauth%3Ascope%3Aauth.globus.org%3Aview_identity_set+urn%3Aglobus%3Aauth%3Ascope%3Atransfer.api.globus.org%3Aall+urn%3Aglobus%3Aauth%3Ascope%3Agroups.api.globus.org%3Aall+urn%3Aglobus%3Aauth%3Ascope%3Asearch.api.globus.org%3Aall\u0026amp;state=_default\u0026amp;response_type=code\u0026amp;access_type=offline\u0026amp;prompt=login ------------------------------------ Enter the resulting Authorization Code here: You should then see the following:\nYou have successfully logged in to the Globus CLI!

Follow the instructions which should complete the process, then return to your terminal session.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s find another collection, this time a public test collection which can be used for performance testing:\nglobus endpoint search \u0026#34;star dtn\u0026#34; ID | Owner | Display Name ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- ff2ee779-54fb-4dac-ade2-57568c587ae3 | esnet@globusid.org | ESnet STAR DTN private collection ece400da-0182-4777-91d6-27a1808f8371 | esnet@globusid.org | ESnet Starlight DTN (Anonymous read only testing) e9e0d9f4-c419-44e0-8198-017fd61bf0c4 | esnet@globusid.org | ESnet Starlight DTN (read-write testing) We\u0026rsquo;ll use the one labelled Anonymous read only testing. Set stardtn to the ID of this endpoint:\nexport stardtn=ece400da-0182-4777-91d6-27a1808f8371 \u0026nbsp; None of the endpoints mentioned so far require authentication in order to use them. This makes demonstrating basic functionality simpler, but we\u0026rsquo;ll look at how to use one that does, later. Listing files at a path on an collection Use the endpoint ls command to list the contents of the stardtn endpoint, at the path /\nglobus ls $stardtn:/ 500GB-in-large-files/ 50GB-in-medium-files/ 5GB-in-small-files/ 5MB-in-tiny-files/ Climate-Huge/ Climate-Large/ Climate-Medium/ Climate-Small/ bebop/ logs/ write-testing/ 100G.dat 100M.dat 10G.dat 10M.dat 1G.dat 1M.dat 500G.dat 50G.dat 50M.dat These are files and directories containing dummy data which can be used for test purposes.\nCopy a file from one endpoint to another Let\u0026rsquo;s transfer the file 1M.dat from the stardtn endpoint to c1:\nglobus transfer $stardtn:/1M.dat $c1:/~/1M.dat Message: The transfer has been accepted and a task has been created and queued for execution Task ID: 74cb181c-bf63-11ee-a90e-032e06ca0965 The transfer task is a separate activity and does not require any connection from the CLI client to either of the 2 endpoints: the Globus transfer service manages the transfer for us.

In the case of the JASMIN Default Collection, you link your Globus identity to your JASMIN identity. This may be different for other collections that you use elsewhere.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s find, then set up an alias to the JASMIN Default Collection Endpoint. We can search for that name:\nglobus endpoint search \u0026#34;jasmin default\u0026#34; ID | Owner | Display Name ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- a2f53b7f-1b4e-4dce-9b7c-349ae760fee0 | a77928d3-f601-40bb-b497-2a31092f8878@clients.auth.globus.org | JASMIN Default Collection Set up an alias for this collection:\nexport jdc=a2f53b7f-1b4e-4dce-9b7c-349ae760fee0 If you\u0026rsquo;ve already interacted with this collection recently, you should find that you can list it with the CLI already. If not, you will be prompted to authenticate. Follow through all the steps until you complete the process, then return to the terminal session.\nIf successful, you can now interact with the JASMIN endpoint, for example listing your home directory:\nglobus ls $jdc:/~/ ... (file listing of your JASMIN home directory) ... The authentication via your JASMIN account lasts for 30 days, so you can run and re-run transfers during that period without needing to repeat the process (hence without any human interaction, if you have scheduled/automated transfers, see below).\nIf this needs to be renewed, then:\nthe simple way to do this is to either:\n(manually) visit the Globus web interface and access the JASMIN Default Collection again (manuall) use the CLI to list the collection again In either case, if the authentication has timed out, you will be prompted to follow instructions to renew it, then the action (listing the directory) should complete successfully.\nThere are ways to do use a \u0026ldquo;refresh token\u0026rdquo; programatically to renew the authentication. Watch this space for details of how to do that (or f)\nAutomation \u0026nbsp; The functionality demonstrated above can be combined into scripts which can perform useful, repeatable tasks such as:\nrecursively syncing the contents of directories between 2 endpoints Globus provide 2 implementations of this here:\nExamples of automation using the Globus CLI\u0026nbsp; , specifically:\ncli-sync.sh\u0026nbsp; : bash script using the Globus CLI as demonstrated above globus_folder_sync.py\u0026nbsp; : Python code using the Globus Python Software Development Kit (SDK) We have not covered the Python SDK here, but this is a useful example of how you could integrate Globus transfer functionality into your own code and workflows. You would need to install and authorise this SDK first.\nTaking the first of these examples, we can adapt it slightly:\n1. Select the JASMIN endpoint at the destination, and set the destination path. Modify the corresponding variables in the script to these values:\nDESTINATION_COLLECTION=\u0026#39;a2f53b7f-1b4e-4dce-9b7c-349ae760fee0\u0026#39; #JASMIN Default Collection ID DESTINATION_PATH=\u0026#39;/home/users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/sync-demo/\u0026#39; #replace \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; with your JASMIN username \u0026nbsp; For STFC users only where the other collection in the transfer is within the STFC network, an additional collection is provided \u0026ldquo;JASMIN STFC Internal Collection\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp; and has ID 9efc947f-5212-4b5f-8c9d-47b93ae676b7. 2. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already, activate the Python virtual environment where you have the CLI installed, and login:\nsource ~/.globus-cli-venv/bin/activate globus login 3. Check that you can interact with the JASMIN collection from the CLI, by trying to list it\nFollow any instructions needed, if you need to renew your authentication.\n4. Run the script to sync the data from the Globus Tutorial Endpoint to the destination directory.\nYou should see output similar to that shown below.\n./cli-sync.sh Checking for a previous transfer Last transfer f5db7238-8f06-11ec-8fe0-dfc5b31adbac SUCCEEDED, continuing Verified that source is a directory Submitted sync from 6c54cade-bde5-45c1-bdea-f4bd71dba2cc:/share/godata/ to a2f53b7f-1b4e-4dce-9b7c-349ae760fee0:/~/sync-demo/ Link: https://app.globus.org/activity/04e277f4-8f07-11ec-811e-493dd0cf73a1/overview Saving sync transfer ID to last-transfer-id.txt 5. Check on the status of the task. You could do this by\nfollowing the URL to https://app.globus.org\u0026nbsp; to view the task under \u0026ldquo;activities\u0026rdquo;, or globus task show \u0026lt;taskid\u0026gt; 6. You could then make some change to either source or destination directory, and simply re-run the script\n./cli-sync.sh 7. Experiment by changing the SYNCTYPE. Other options are:\nSee here for descriptions of the available sync levels\u0026nbsp; :\nEXISTS SIZE MTYPE CHECKSUM 8. Automating repeats of the sync operation\nYou could then consider how to repeat the task automatically. For example:\ntriggering a re-run of the cli-sync.sh command according to some condition that\u0026rsquo;s met in your workflow. scheduling the running of the cli-sync.sh command on your own machine using cron on your own machine. Remember: the invocation of the command does NOT need to be done on JASMIN, it can be done wherever you have the CLI installed, for example your local machine. use the web interface (go to \u0026ldquo;Transfer \u0026amp; Timer Options\u0026rdquo;) to configure repeating tasks initiated there. Learn about how to use timers with Globus\u0026nbsp; : these can be set up using the web interface or using an additional CLI globus-timer-cli\u0026nbsp; which can be installed into the same virtualenv as the main globus cli. Learn about Globus Flows\u0026nbsp; to create fully automated workflows. Globus have created a number of pre-canned workflow actions (e.g. \u0026ldquo;make directory\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;transfer\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;delete\u0026rdquo;, ..) which you can chain together in your own workflow, or combine with your own to create custom workflows. A useful example might be: watching a directory for arrival/creation of a certain file triggering a compute/analysis step on files in the directory (using a Globus Compute\u0026nbsp; endpoint of your own?) transferring the output of that analysis to elsewhere, and cleaning up"

        content: "Introduction \u0026nbsp; This article describes how to create your own Globus collection using Globus Connect Personal.\nPlease read Globus transfers with JASMIN first for a wider introduction to Globus.\nUsing Globus Connect Personal (GCP)\u0026nbsp; would enable you to transfer files to/from another Globus collection using any of the Globus Online transfer tools ( Web app\u0026nbsp; , CLI\u0026nbsp; or Python SDK\u0026nbsp; .\nThe term \u0026ldquo;endpoint\u0026rdquo; has changed meaning with version 5 of Globus, so users now interact with \u0026ldquo;collections\u0026rdquo;. but see Endpoints vs Collections\u0026nbsp; for a fuller explanation of these entities.\nFor example, if you set up GCP on your desktop/laptop, you could transfer data files to/from your home directory or other storage on JASMIN.\n\u0026nbsp; You may not need to do this if your institution already has a Globus endpoint available to you. You should NOT install this on a JASMIN server, as a Globus endpoint is already provided for you. If you plan to install it in your user area on your departmental server, check with your local IT administrator whether that\u0026rsquo;s an OK thing to do. Point them at the relevant Globus documentation but note that you should be able to do the install with regular/user privileges and that the software does not usually need to be left running: it can be started for the duration of any data transfer tasks, then stopped once they have completed. Set up Globus Connect Personal on end-user machine \u0026nbsp; Installers are available for Linux, Mac and Windows operating systems:\nLinux (command-line) https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-linux/#globus-connect-personal-cli\u0026nbsp; Mac https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-mac/\u0026nbsp; Windows https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-windows/\u0026nbsp; The instructions below show the process for Linux (command-line):\nThese commands should be executed on YOUR OWN MACHINE (not JASMIN):\nwget https://downloads.globus.org/globus-connect-personal/linux/stable/globusconnectpersonal-latest.tgz tar xzf globusconnectpersonal-latest.tgz This will produce a versioned globusconnectpersonal directory Replace x.y.z in the line below with the version number you see\ncd globusconnectpersonal-x.y.z ./globusconnectpersonal (see links above for details of how to install without the graphical user interface, if you need to)\nComplete the installation using the setup key. If a graphical environment is detected, a window will appear, to guide you through the steps. If not, text prompts will appear.\n(Please see the relevant installation guide for your platform, linked above, for further details)\nStart Globus Connect Personal (Linux) \u0026nbsp; ./globusconnectpersonal -start If you use the web application at https://app.globus.org\u0026nbsp; , you should now be able to see your GCP endpoint listed under \u0026ldquo;Collections\u0026rdquo; when you filter by \u0026ldquo;Administered by you\u0026rdquo;. You can now try listing the files on it and perhaps transferring a file to/from one of the Globus Tutorial endpoints using the web interface.\nThe setup process will have prompted you for a name for your endpoint. It is assigned a unique ID, too.\nIf you have the Globus Command-Line Interface installed ( see here), you can find the ID of your own endpoint with the CLI command:\nglobus endpoint search \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; --filter-owner-id \u0026lt;your globus id\u0026gt; If successful, you should now be able to interact with your endpoint via any of the Globus tools (web app, CLI and Python SDK).\nFor example, you could list the files on the endpoint:\nglobus ls \u0026lt;endpoint_id\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;path\u0026gt; Set directory permissions \u0026nbsp; Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to configure which directory paths on your system can be accessed by GCP. By default these may NOT be accessible, so you need to allow access.\nWindows: GCP icon in taskbar, then Options / Access Mac: menu bar icon / Preferences / Access Linux: by editing the config file ~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths, see here\u0026nbsp; for syntax."

        content: "This article describes how to do data transfers to and from JASMIN using Globus\u0026nbsp; , an online data transfer service designed specifically for moving large datasets between research institutions.\n\u0026nbsp; Globus now replaces the previous certificate-based gridftp service.\nAlthough gridftp transfers are currently still possible (using the perhaps confusingly-named globus-url-copy client tool still available on the transfer servers), this now only works with ssh authentication.\nMain differences \u0026nbsp; JASMIN moved to a newer version of Globus in 2023, resulting in a few changes:\nUsers now interact with a collection Most users: please use \u0026ldquo;JASMIN Default Collection\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp; with ID a2f53b7f-1b4e-4dce-9b7c-349ae760fee0 For STFC users only where the other collection (either GCP or GCS\u0026nbsp; ) is within STFC, an additional collection is provided \u0026ldquo;JASMIN STFC Internal Collection\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp; and has ID 9efc947f-5212-4b5f-8c9d-47b93ae676b7. You now use the JASMIN Accounts Portal to authenticate (using your JASMIN account credentials) via OpenID Connect (OIDC). During the authentication process, you are redirected to the JASMIN Accounts Portal to link your Globus identity with your JASMIN account. Consent needs to be granted at a number of points in the process to allow the Globus service to carry out actions on your behalf. The default lifetime of the authentication granted to your JASMIN account is now 30 days. After this, you may need to refresh the consent for your \u0026ldquo;session\u0026rdquo;. This service is now available to all users of JASMIN: you no longer need the hpxfer access role (now removed). The following examples show you how to authenticate with the new JASMIN Default Collection and list the contents of your home directory. As before, however, the following file systems are available via this collection\nFile system Access $HOME (/home/users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;) Read-write /gws (group workspaces) Read-write /work/xfc (transfer cache) Read-write /badc (CEDA Archive) /neodc Read-only List your home directory using the web app \u0026nbsp; 1. Navigate to https://app.globus.org\u0026nbsp; 2. Log in with your Globus identity (this could be a globusid.org or other identity)\nlog in 3. In File Manager, use the search tool to search for \u0026ldquo;JASMIN Default Collection\u0026rdquo;. Select it.\nFind JASMIN Default Collection 4. In the transfer pane, you are told that Authentication/Consent is required. Click Continue.\nConsent 5. Click the link to use the JASMIN Accounts Portal OIDC server to link your JASMIN identity\n6. You are taken to a page on the JASMIN Accounts portal, where you are invited to \u0026ldquo;Authorise\u0026rdquo; the external application to authenticate and access your essential account information.\nAuthorise application 7. If successful, you are taken back to the Globus web app, where you are invited to \u0026ldquo;Allow\u0026rdquo; the app to use the listed information and services.\nAllow the app to use the info 8. The directory listing of your home directory should now appear in the transfer pane.\n9. Try navigating to another collection known to you (previously known as endpoint) in the other pane and transferring some data. If you have Globus Connect Personal running locally, you should be able to transfer files to/from that.\nList your home directory using the command-line interface (CLI) \u0026nbsp; 1. Load the virtual environment where you have the Globus CLI installed:\n(in this example, a Python virtual environment named ~/.globus-cli-venv already exists. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t create one with the command python3 -m venv ~/.globus-cli-venv on your local machine). Activate this virtual environment as follows:\nsource ~/.globus-cli-venv/bin/activate 2. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to update to the latest version of the CLI by doing the following:\npip install -U globus-cli 3. Check that you have an active globus session and follow any instructions given, e.g.\nglobus login globus session show 4. Use the \u0026ldquo;globus ls\u0026rdquo; command to list the collection using its ID, starting at the path of your home directory (/~/)\nglobus ls a2f53b7f-1b4e-4dce-9b7c-349ae760fee0:/~/ TIP: you can set the ID of the collection to be an environment variable like this, for convenience:\nexport JASMIN_GLOBUS=a2f53b7f-1b4e-4dce-9b7c-349ae760fee0 globus ls $JASMIN_GLOBUS:/~/ 6. You will be taken through an equivalent set of steps to those needed for the web app. First off, you will be asked to copy/paste a URL into your browser and copy/paste back the resulting authentication code.\n7. Once the authentication/consent process has been completed, you should see a listing of your home directory.\n8. Use the globus transfer command to copy data to/from another collection (previously known as endpoint) to your home directory, within the JASMIN Default Collection. (see globus transfer --help for details)\nWhere to/from? \u0026nbsp; Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that to actually transfer data to/from JASMIN (e.g. step 8, above), you\u0026rsquo;ll need another collection somewhere else. If you\u0026rsquo;re transferring data from ARCHER2, you can use their ARCHER2 filesystems collection (id: 3e90d018-0d05-461a-bbaf-aab605283d21)\u0026nbsp; If not, unless your institution runs a Globus collection, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install a small piece of software called Globus Connect Personal on a machine at that end that is able to read/write the data that you want to transfer. A good idea is to try this on your own desktop/laptop first.\nOur help doc guides you through how to do this and some examples of how to use it. Versions available for Windows, Mac and Linux."

        content: "\u0026nbsp; Updated advice Nov 2024, now works for all platforms if you update your SSH key. Introduction \u0026nbsp; This service provides a graphical Linux desktop on JASMIN, ideal for use with graphics-heavy tasks like interactive work with large images. The desktop environment includes a Firefox web browser which can be used to access internal-only web resources. Using graphical applications over a wide-area network can be very slow, and is not recommended or supported on JASMIN. This service provides a better alternative with graphical desktop within the JASMIN environment itself, rather than on the user\u0026rsquo;s local machine.\nA small client application, available for you to install on your local machine, enables you to connect to specific servers within JASMIN. Graphics are then relayed to the client application in a more efficient form, resulting in much better performance particularly if you need to interact with what\u0026rsquo;s being displayed.\nThe service provides an improved user experience and is strongly recommended over standard X11 graphics.\nThe following servers have the NX service available and can be used as described below. These now have identical configuration, so you can use any one of them from any network location.\nname notes nx1.jasmin.ac.uk nx2.jasmin.ac.uk nx3.jasmin.ac.uk nx4.jasmin.ac.uk (new server now available) Notes \u0026nbsp; The nx* servers should only be used with Nomachine Enterprise Client as described below, other than for testing your connection, as this preserves system resources for their intended purpose. Although the graphical desktop session should persist when you close the client (unless you specifically log out), you should not rely on this feature, so please don\u0026rsquo;t report this as a problem: occasionally machines run out of resources and sessions get killed. Keeping sessions open consumes resources on the server even when you\u0026rsquo;re not using the session, which may mean that other users can\u0026rsquo;t use the service. Installing NoMachine Enterprise Client \u0026nbsp; Download the appropriate version of the NoMachine Enterprise Client\u0026nbsp; from NoMachine. That page contains links to several different products: The only one you need to install is NoMachine Enterprise Client.\nVersions are available for Windows, Mac and Linux. You may need privileges on your local machine in order to install the software so you may need to ask for help from your local IT helpdesk.\nNote that Nomachine Enterprise Client is a different application to the \u0026ldquo;Nomachine Enterprise Desktop\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Nomachine\u0026rdquo; available from the more publicised download links on the NoMachine website or other applications in the NoMachine suite: the desktop edition contains additional components to enable remote access to your own (local) machine from a remote location: perhaps convenient but not what we are trying to enable for you here.\nThe NoMachine Enterprise Client is a cut-down client to which connects to a remote server: in your case, the server is at the JASMIN end, where the desktop session will exist.\nRemember to check for updates for the enterprise client to ensure you always have the latest stable version. You can configure the application to check for updates (and optionally apply them automatically) by going to Settings / Updates in the menu.\nSetting up your connection \u0026nbsp; There are 2 methods of using your SSH key which should work with JASMIN, these affect how you set up the connection:\nMethod pros/cons 1. Specify the location of your SSH private key \u0026nbsp; simple \u0026nbsp; no admin permissions needed\n\u0026nbsp; works for all platforms if you update your key to ECDSA 2. Use your key stored in a local ssh-agent \u0026nbsp; useful if you use other applications which use SSH (e.g. VSCode)\n\u0026nbsp; may need admin permissions for 1st-time agent setup\n\u0026nbsp; careful editing of config file required in some cases For a simple terminal connection to JASMIN, you would follow the instructions in presenting your ssh key, but the NoMachine client needs you to do it a slightly different way. The same principles apply however.\nMethod 1: specifying key location \u0026nbsp; Videos for each platform (click the tab for your operating system):\nWindows Mac Linux Notes:\nThis method has now been tested with Windows 10 and 11, but requires you to update your SSH key to ECDSA. Step-by-step instructions \u0026nbsp; Step by step instructions (click to expand) Open the NX client On Mac and Windows, click the NoMachine Icon On Linux, the default location for the executable once installed is /usr/NX/bin/nxplayer, so you may want to add this to your $PATH. Your desktop environment may enable you to add an icon to your desktop. In the \u0026ldquo;Machines\u0026rdquo; view, select \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;re now in the \u0026ldquo;Address\u0026rdquo; tab. Type a name for this connection profile, and the full hostname, e.g. nx1.jasmin.ac.uk. Set the Protocol to \u0026ldquo;SSH\u0026rdquo;, which will change the port to 22. Go to the \u0026ldquo;Configuration\u0026rdquo; tab. Choose \u0026ldquo;Use key-based authentication with a key you provide\u0026rdquo; , then click the Modify button to the right. The default is \u0026ldquo;Use password authentication\u0026rdquo;: don\u0026rsquo;t use this. Use the button to the right to navigate to your private key, or type the path in the box. Your private key may be in a hidden directory e.g. ~/.ssh (see \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;/test-decap-help/docs/interactive-computing/graphical-linux-desktop-access-using-nx#cant-find-your-private-key\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Troubleshooting\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;) 1. For security, it is recommended NOT to \u0026quot;import the private key to the connection file\u0026quot; (store it in an **encrypted** password manager instead). 1. Make sure you tick the box \u0026quot;Forward Authentication\u0026quot; **IMPORTANT** Go back to the \u0026ldquo;Add connection\u0026rdquo; dialog If all is correct, click \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; Once you have created the connection profile, go to Connecting, below, and continue from there.\nMethod 2: using an agent \u0026nbsp; The alternative profile for using an agent instead, is very similar but we need to select option \u0026ldquo;Use key-based authentication with a SSH agent\u0026rdquo;.\nVideos for each platform:\nWindows (OpenSSH) Mac Linux Step-by-step instructions \u0026nbsp; Steps in more detail (click to expand) In the \u0026ldquo;Machines\u0026rdquo; view, select \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;re now in the \u0026ldquo;Address\u0026rdquo; tab. Type a name for this connection profile, and the full hostname, e.g. nx1.jasmin.ac.uk. Set the Protocol to \u0026ldquo;SSH\u0026rdquo;, which will change the port to 22. Go to the \u0026ldquo;Configuration\u0026rdquo; tab. Choose \u0026ldquo;Use key-based authentication with a SSH agent\u0026rdquo; , then click the Modify button to the right. Make sure you tick the box \u0026ldquo;Forward Authentication\u0026rdquo; IMPORTANT Go back to the \u0026ldquo;Add connection\u0026rdquo; dialog If all is correct, click \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; Once you have created the connection profile, go to Connecting, below, and continue from there.\nConnecting \u0026nbsp; Connecting with method 1 (key) \u0026nbsp; Follow the steps in the video to show how to connect to the desktop on the nx server, and to make the onward connection to the sci server:\nWindows Mac Linux Notes:\nThis method has now been thoroughly tested with the new ECDSA keys and should work for Windows 10 and 11 users if you have updated your key. Make sure you have returned your ~/.nx/config/player.cfg file to its default state if you edited this previously. The relevant lines should be reset as follows, but remember to edit the file with the NoMachine Enterprise Client application closed: \u0026lt;option key=\u0026#34;SSH client mode\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;library\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option key=\u0026#34;SSH Client\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;nxssh.exe\u0026#34;\u0026gt; If it does not work for you particular setup however, please try one of Methods 2: OpenSSH or 2: Pageant instead. Step-by-step instructions \u0026nbsp; Steps in more detail (click to expand) You\u0026rsquo;ll be asked for your username and the passphrase for your key. It is NOT recommended to save your passphrase in the connection file. Click OK You may see a list of all the other desktop sessions currently in progress from other users. Ignore these and click \u0026ldquo;New desktop\u0026rdquo;. Select \u0026ldquo;Create a new virtual desktop\u0026rdquo;, then click \u0026ldquo;Create\u0026rdquo; Note the instructions for how to reach the NX menu once in the session, and select screen settings from the list of icons: Recommended setting is \u0026ldquo;Fit to window\u0026rdquo; (leftmost icon) Click OK on this and subsequent screens giving information about the NX and desktop environments. You should be presented with a linux deskop on the server to which you connected, e.g. nx1.jasmin.ac.uk You should be presented with a linux deskop on the server to which you connected, e.g. nx1.jasmin.ac.uk Locate the icon to open the \u0026ldquo;Terminal\u0026rdquo; application (bottom of window in Rocky 9 desktop) The video demonstrates making an onward connection to a sci server and testing the graphics functionality by opening the xterm application on that server, before exiting and logging out of the NX desktop. Connecting with method 2 (agent) \u0026nbsp; Overview of this method:\nIn summary, we need to:\nLoad the SSH private key into a local ssh-agent Unless using Pageant as the agent, edit the NX configuration file to use the native ssh client instead of the NoMachine \u0026ldquo;library\u0026rdquo; one. Use the connection profile we created earlier, to connect. 1. Load your SSH private key into your authentication agent\nFollow the instructions for your platform here, then return once you have successfully loaded your key. for Windows, this can be either the Windows \u0026ldquo;OpenSSH Client\u0026rdquo; optional feature, or Pageant, which is part of the PuTTY suite of SSH tools, but not any other ssh-agent. The MobaXterm agent \u0026ldquo;MobAgent\u0026rdquo; will not work for this purpose. for Linux, you may find that a \u0026ldquo;local\u0026rdquo; ssh-agent does not work: for example using Gnome desktop, you may need to use the global one for your desktop environment, e.g. gnome-keyring-daemon --start instead, before doing ssh-add \u0026lt;key\u0026gt; 2. Edit the NX configuration file\nOpen the file .nx/config/player.cfg in a simple text editor (e.g. Windows Notepad). The .nx directory should be in your home directory.\nTowards the end of the file, you should see two lines like this:\n\u0026lt;option key=\u0026#34;SSH client mode\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;library\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option key=\u0026#34;SSH Client\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;nxssh.exe\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Change them as follows:\n(the changes are slightly different for each platform) Windows (OpenSSH) Windows (Pageant) Mac Linux \u0026lt;option key=\u0026#34;SSH client mode\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;native\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option key=\u0026#34;SSH Client\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;C:\\Windows\\System32\\OpenSSH\\ssh.exe\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Leave the file unaltered, with the default settings, as above. \u0026lt;option key=\u0026#34;SSH client mode\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;native\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option key=\u0026#34;SSH Client\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;/usr/bin/ssh\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option key=\u0026#34;SSH client mode\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;native\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option key=\u0026#34;SSH Client\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;/usr/bin/ssh\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Save and close the file before opening NoMachine Enterprise Client.\nNext, follow the video below for actually connecting, or see the step-by-step instructions below:\nWindows (OpenSSH) Windows (Pageant) Mac Linux This video covers the whole process, incuding how to convert the key using PuTTYgen and load it using Pageant, then set up a connection and use it to connect.\nStep-by-step instructions \u0026nbsp; Steps in more detail (click to expand) Enter your JASMIN username in the box Click OK You may see a list of all the other desktop sessions currently in progress from other users. Ignore these and click \u0026ldquo;New desktop\u0026rdquo;. Select \u0026ldquo;Create a new virtual desktop\u0026rdquo;, then click \u0026ldquo;Create\u0026rdquo; Note the instructions for how to reach the NX menu once in the session, and select screen settings from the list of icons: Recommended setting is \u0026ldquo;Fit to window\u0026rdquo; (leftmost icon) Click OK on this and subsequent screens giving information about the NX and desktop environments. You should be presented with a linux deskop on the server to which you connected, e.g. nx1.jasmin.ac.uk Locate the icon to open the \u0026ldquo;Terminal\u0026rdquo; application (bottom of window in Rocky 9 desktop) The video demonstrates making an onward connection to a sci server and testing the graphics functionality by opening the xterm application on that server, before exiting and logging out of the NX desktop. Using the graphical desktop environment \u0026nbsp; Once you have set up the environment to your liking, you can\nuse the web browser on that system to access web-based resources available only within JASMIN make SSH connections to other systems within JASMIN such as sci-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk use graphical applications on other systems within JASMIN and send the output bask to this desktop the \u0026ldquo;connecting\u0026rdquo; videos above show the steps involved for this. Notes \u0026nbsp; The number of \u0026ldquo;virtual desktops\u0026rdquo; which can be created per user is limited to 1 in order to preserve system resources. Although in theory sessions and desktop windows should persist when you close down the NoMachine client and when you re-open it to the same connection, you should not rely on this feature. Keeping long-running sessions open reduces resources available to other users. The option to shut down the machine does not work for a \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; user (only admins). Please just \u0026ldquo;Log out\u0026rdquo; instead. Troubleshooting \u0026nbsp; Authentication error (Windows users) \u0026nbsp; Update your key to ECDSA (previous recommendation was RSA). This will solve most problems. See updated advice in Generate SSH key pair. Remember to leave 15 minutes after uploading your new public key before trying again, so that the new key can be made available in all the places it needs to be. Transposed symbol keys \u0026nbsp; After the first connection (particularly for Mac users), subsequent connections to the same connection profile sometimes have some symbols keys e.g. @ and \u0026quot; transposed.\nClick the \u0026ldquo;settings\u0026rdquo; option (in the menu, top-right), then go to \u0026ldquo;settings\u0026rdquo; and search for \u0026ldquo;input\u0026rdquo; to look for alternative keyboard layouts.\nConnection timeout \u0026nbsp; Please do not try and connect using the proprietary \u0026ldquo;NX\u0026rdquo; protocol. Select \u0026ldquo;SSH\u0026rdquo; as the protocol. If you mistakenly use \u0026ldquo;NX\u0026rdquo; as the protocol you may see an error similar to the following when you try to connect (The correct port for SSH connections is 22)\nA connection timeout has occurred while trying to connect to \u0026#39;nx1.jasmin.ac.uk\u0026#39; on port \u0026#39;4000\u0026#39;. The issue could either be caused by a networking problem, by a firewall or NAT blocking incoming traffic or by a wrong server address. Please verify your configuration and try again. Client version \u0026nbsp; Make sure you have installed and are using the correct and most recent version of the NoMachine Enterprise Client\u0026nbsp; (not the NoMachine Enterprise Desktop or any other applications from NoMachine).\nKey format \u0026nbsp; If you created your SSH private key using the \u0026ldquo;PuTTYgen\u0026rdquo; application, and are getting \u0026ldquo;Authentication failed\u0026rdquo; for a key pair that you know works OK for simple terminal connections, it could be that you need to convert the private key to \u0026ldquo;OpenSSH format\u0026rdquo; for use here. By doing this you would be creating an alternately-formatted version of the same private key, so the public key stays the same (and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to re-upload that to JASMIN).\nOpen PuTTYgen and \u0026ldquo;Load an existing private key file\u0026rdquo; (click \u0026ldquo;Load\u0026rdquo;) Ignore the notice about saving it in PuTTY\u0026rsquo;s own format (this is not useful here) (click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;) In the PuTTYgen menu, select \u0026ldquo;Conversions\u0026rdquo;, then \u0026ldquo;Export OpenSSH key\u0026rdquo; Save the newly-formatted private key file locally. The passphrase needed to unlock it should not have changed. Use this newly-formatted key file with NoMachine NX. Passphrase vs Password \u0026nbsp; Be sure to use the PASSPHRASE associated with your SSH private key, and not the PASSWORD associated with your JASMIN account, when prompted using the NX client.\nCan\u0026rsquo;t find your private key? \u0026nbsp; The location of your private key on your local machine may be in a hidden directory for example ~/.ssh. In order to navigate to it to provide the location when setting up your connection profile, you may need to enable the display of hidden directories/files in your local desktop environment first. On a Mac you can do this with the shortcut CMD+SHIFT+. . In Windows this is under File Explorer / View / Hidden Items. It\u0026rsquo;s also possible that your home directory itself (normally /Users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;) is not configured to be displayed by default in Finder. If this is case, go to Finder / Preferences / Sidebar / Show these items and tick the box next to the item representing your username: this should make it appear, and .ssh should be a subdirectory of this.\nWindows users may need to switch on \u0026ldquo;show hidden files\u0026rdquo; which is normally an option in File Explorer windows, and/or where you\u0026rsquo;re asked to choose from a list of files.\nCan\u0026rsquo;t make an onward connection \u0026nbsp; Does your username have more than 8 characters? Before we realised this was a problem, some users were not prevented from creating accounts with usernames over 8 characters. The names of the servers are now kept as short as possible e.g. nx1, nx2 so this mitigates the problem in most cases. All the new Rocky 9 NX hosts are now the same in this respect. But if your username is very long (\u0026gt;13 characters) you may still run into problems here, in which case please contact the helpdesk. Update your key to ECDSA: this should solve the problem in most cases. If it\u0026rsquo;s still a problem 15 minutes after uploading your new public key, try: uninstalling the NoMachine Enterprise Client deleting the %USERPROFILE%\\.nx (Windows) or ~\\.nx (Mac/Linux) directory on your machine deleting the %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\NoMachine or ~\\NoMachine directory on your machine (beware this will remove all connection profiles) rebooting, then re-installing and trying again. Can\u0026rsquo;t display graphics from sci machine or other onward connection \u0026nbsp; Did you omit the -X option from the SSH command when you made the onward connection to that machine? Try -Y if -X doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for you.\nDisk space \u0026nbsp; Check your disk usage in your JASMIN home directory: if this is over the 100G limit, you may not be able to write any temporary files and this could prevent NoMachine from being able to start a new session or even reconnect to an existing virtual desktop session. Clear out some space and re-check with pdu -sh $HOME to find out how much space you\u0026rsquo;re using.\nCan\u0026rsquo;t connect or gets stuck connecting to a previous session \u0026nbsp; Sometimes, you can\u0026rsquo;t connect because you have a previous session which did not terminate correectly, or you might have problems reconnecting to a previous desktop session. Sometimes the client will get stuck with a \u0026ldquo;spinning wheel\u0026rdquo; before eventually timing out. You can terminate your own previous session as follows:\nFollow instructions in Connecting until the point where all the other users\u0026rsquo; sessions on the machine are displayed. Find the one corresponding to your username Right-click it and select \u0026ldquo;Terminate session\u0026rdquo; Note that you may lose any unsaved work in the session that you terminate, but it should clear the stuck session and allow you to reconnect. Please try this first before asking the support team, as this is the first thing that they will try in order to clear your session.\n\u0026ldquo;It worked yesterday\u0026rdquo; \u0026nbsp; For occasions where \u0026ldquo;it worked last time I tried to connect, but now doesn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo;, please first try the above step to clear any previous session which might have got stuck, otherwise the time-honoured IT support advice of \u0026ldquo;turning it off and on again\u0026rdquo; is applicable: try restarting the machine where you are using NoMachine Enterprise Client, as this can sometimes clear issues with the client, your machine or your network connection. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to re-connect via your VPN if available."

        description: "Data Transfer Tools: GridFTP (SSH authentication)",
        
        
        content: "This article describes how to transfer data using GridFTP with SSH authentication.\n\u0026nbsp; The globus-url-copy command used here should not be confused with the Globus online data transfer service. They used to be associated, but no longer. If you are starting out and looking for a reliable, high-performance transfer method, the recommendation now is to learn about Globus Transfers with JASMIN (using the Globus online data transfer service) instead of command-line gridftp as described in this document. Introduction \u0026nbsp; GridFTP is the recommended tool for transferring large files or groups of files across high-speed Wide-Area Networks (WANs). It is commonly used with certificate-based authentication, but can also take place between suitably configured* server and client using SSH as the authentication mechanism.\nThe client may need to have certain ports enabled on the host or institutional firewall if present. Consult your local IT support desk for details and direct them to Configuring GridFTP\u0026nbsp; .\nSSH-based GridFTP does not enable the full feature set provided by certificate-based GridFTP and in particular does not work with Globus Online, which provides useful interfaces and APIs for managing large-scale data transfers, but still provides a major step up in performance by \u0026ldquo;filling the pipe\u0026rdquo; more efficiently than scp/rsync/sftp, particularly over longer distances and can do verification and sync operations as part of the transfer.\nSee also:\nTransfer servers for details on which servers within JASMIN have GridFTP available. Transfers from ARCHER2 for details of different routes affecting your choice of server (since this is the one of the most likely places to which JASMIN users will want to transfer data to/from) Establishing a connection \u0026nbsp; Since you will be using SSH as the authentication mechanism, you should ensure that your initial connection to the JASIMN transfer server is made with the -A option enabled, to enable agent forwarding:\nssh -A username1@hpxfer3.jasmin.ac.uk Use the globus-url-copy command to list the contents of your home directory on the remote server (This will only work if you already know that that server supports GridFTP over SSH). In this case, we are making the connection to a fictitious server gridftp.remotesite.ac.uk:\nglobus-url-copy -vb -list sshftp://username2@gridftp.remotesite.ac.uk/ If username and username2 are the same (on the different systems), the username@ part of the sshftp URI can be omitted.\nNote that the URI of the server, in this case sshftp://username2@gridftp.remotesite.ac.uk must come immediately after (as it is an argument to) the -list option. This is particularly important if you are combining this command with other options.\nExample GridFTP usage \u0026nbsp; Once you have successfully established that you can connect to the server (as above), then you should be able to transfer data between the remote end (server) and local end (client) with commands such as shown below:\nAs above, if you have the same username on both local and remote systems, then the username@ part of the sshftp URI can be omitted.\nPlease consult the documentation for the globus-url-copy command for the full range of options and arguments.\nglobus-url-copy -help See also http://toolkit.globus.org/toolkit/docs/latest-stable/gridftp/user/#gridftp-user-basic\u0026nbsp; 2. Download a file from remote directory /home/users/USERNAME to destination on the local (client) machine, for example a group workspace on JASMIN:\nglobus-url-copy -vb sshftp://username@gridftp.remotesite.ac.uk/home/users/USERNAME/myfile /group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace/myfile The -p N and -fast options can additionally be used in combination to enable N parallel streams at once, as shown below. You can experiment with N in the range 4 to 32 to obtain the best performance, but please be aware that many parallel transfers can draw heavily on shared resources and degrade performance for other users:\nglobus-url-copy -vb -p 16 -fast sshftp://username@gridftp.remotesite.ac.uk/home/users/USERNAME/myfile /group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace/myfile 3. Test performance with large files by downloading from /dev/zero on the remote server to /dev/null locally. This excludes any interaction with either filesystem and gives an upper limit to the performance that can be achieved at the time. Repeat with values of N in the range 4 to 32 to compare rates. Note that the performance takes a while to \u0026ldquo;ramp up\u0026rdquo;, so you will not see the best rates if transferring small files individually as the process never gets up to full speed:\nglobus-url-copy -vb -p 16 -fast sshftp://username@gridftp.remotesite.ac.uk/dev/zero /dev/null Press CTRL-C to interrupt the transfer. Alternatively you can specify that the transfer should continue for a fixed duration in seconds using the -t option. In this example, data is transferred from the remote host gridftp.remotesite.ac.uk to jasmin-xfer2.ceda.ac.uk.\nglobus-url-copy -p 16 -fast -t 10 -vb sshftp://username2@gridftp.remotesite.ac.uk/dev/zero /dev/null Source: sshftp://username2@gridftp.remotesite.ac.uk/dev/ Dest: file:///dev/ zero -\u0026gt; null 7797473280 bytes 929.52 MB/sec avg 1024.49 MB/sec inst Cancelling copy... Note the transfer rate achieved in Megabytes/second (MB/sec), although for various reasons this is not to be relied upon as an accurate expectation of speed for real transfers. However, you are unlikely to achieve even half of this data rate viascp, rsync or sftp over the same route. Bbcp may achieve similar rates, however, and this is considered by some as easier to use.\n4. Recursively download the contents of a directory on a remote location to a local destination.\nglobus-url-copy -vb -p 4 -fast -cc 4 -cd -r sshftp://username2@gridftp.remotesite.ac.uk/home/users/USERNAME/mydir/ /group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace/mydir/ Where:\n-cc N requests N concurrent transfers (in this case, each with p=4 parallel streams) -cd requests creation of the destination directory if this does not already exist -r denotes recursive transfer of directories -sync and -sync-level options can be used to synchronise data between the two locations, where destination files do not exist or differ (by criteria that can be selected) from corresponding source files. See -help option for details. Upload data (push data from JASMIN to remote server) \u0026nbsp; The above commands can also be adapted to invoke transfers from a local source to a remote destination, i.e. uploading data, since the commands all take the following general form:\nglobus-url-copy [OPTIONS] source-uri desination-uri Be sure to check your connection with the remote machine via a simple SSH login and then a directory listing as shown above.\nJASMIN host as remote server \u0026nbsp; So far the examples have used a server within JASMIN as the client in the GridFTP transfer. The transfer can be reversed so that the client is elsewhere and the JASMIN host is the server specified in the destination URI. The following command should work connecting to one of the xfer or hpxfer servers (consult those pages for current list).\nPush data to JASMIN from a remote server:\nglobus-url-copy -vb -p 8 -fast mydir/myfile sshftp://username@hpxfer3.jasmin.ac.uk/group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace/mydir/ Note that for this to work, you need to be able to authenticate over SSH to the JASMIN host. This should be possible if you can log in interactively, but will NOT work if you are using the command in a cron job or other situation where your ssh-agent (on the host remote to JASMIN) is not running and/or does not have access to your private key.\nInstead, for those situations, use Globus"

An approximately fortnightly check of the contents of all GWSs. As a GWS Manager you will receive e-mails summarising the usage and contents of the GWS. By default this is a simple volume level summary of the GWS.\nCustomisation \u0026nbsp; If you wish for additional directories to be scanned and summarised please add these to the GWS_PATH/.gws_scan/config.ini, where GWS_PATH is the path to your group workspace (the directory and the file may need to be created). Directories can also be excluded from the scan in the same way. This can be useful for speeding up the run time of a scan. Here is an example of a config.ini file.\n\u0026nbsp; Please note that the required directory for this configuration data is .gws_scan, not .gws_scanner - the latter is from the previous incarnation of the scanner, and will be be removed in due course) [general] # GWS fullness threshold for which the daily scan will send a warning email (default 83) (in %) volume_warning_threshold = 83 # Directories to check for largest sub-dir and filetypes below (comma separated list), these paths must be relative to the group workspace path i.e. path/to/dir, not /group/workspace/path/to/dir # Defaults to all top level directories inside volume dirs = dir1,path/to/dir2 # Directories to exclude from the scan. This can be useful to speed up the scan if there are know directories with a large number of files, for which the scan information is not very useful excl_dirs = path/to/excl, large_dir # Filetype extensions to count inside directories above (comma separated list) # Defaults to none exts = html,py,jsdirs and excl_dirs can have the * wildcard anywhere in the directory path. From the config above for example: path/to/*, and p*h/to/dir2 would pick up the directory /path/to/dir2, and any other directories which matched the pattern.\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t comment out the arguments. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use one just leave it blank, this will then just use the internal defaults. E.g.\n[general] volume_warning_threshold = dirs = excl_dirs = exts = Report \u0026nbsp; When the fortnightly scan runs it sends the output to the GWS manager as an email, which looks like this:\n### Group Workspace Report for: GWS_PATH #### Scan Details Time most recent scan started: 16/04/2019 - 10:15:57 Time most recent scan finished: 16/04/2019 - 12:25:27 Duration of most recent scan (h:m:s): 2:09:29 Scan Complete: True #### Usage Details Filesystem: fuse.quobyte Total Storage: 199.2 TiB Used Storage: 81.8 TiB Free Storage: 117.4 TiB Usage: 42% #### Directory Details To get information about specific directories within this volume, please add the relative paths to the volume config file (.gws_scan/config.ini) - see [https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4499-gws-scanner](https://mjpritchard.github.io/test-decap-help/docs/short-term-project-storage/gws-scanner/) **Directory** | **Total Files** | **Total Size** | **Sub-directory with most files** | **Files in this Sub-directory** ---|---|---|---|--- all_dirs | 238336 | 81.8 TiB | GWS_PATH/dir1/example/path | 7929 .gws_scanner | 0 | 0.0 B | None | 0 dir1 | 0 | 0.0 B | GWS_PATH/dir1/example/path | 0 #### Filetype Details To get information on the quantity and size of specific filetypes under the directories above, please add the relevant file extensions to the volume config file (.gws_scan/config.ini) - see [https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4499-gws-scanner](https://mjpritchard.github.io/test-decap-help/docs/short-term-project-storage/gws-scanner/) _No filetypes requested_"

        content: "The Group Workspace (GWS) Scanner\u0026nbsp; UI is an interactive web application for JASMIN users to view their GWSs.\nPlease note this service is under beta-testing and should be used with care (July 2023)\nWhat is the GWS Scanner UI? \u0026nbsp; A GWS is collaborative storage made available to a group for a project. The GWS Scanner UI provides information about the structure of GWSs in the form of a tree graph showing the folders within the GWS. The tiles of the graph can be scaled or coloured by size, count or heat.\nSize refers to the size (in TB or GB) of the folder count refers to the number of files and folders within the directory heat refers to the average time since last access (hot = recent). The tree graph only shows tiles for the folders within the GWS, the files are lumped together as unindexed children, but the files are considered in the calculation of the GWS statistics - e.g. the number of children is the number of folders and files within the GWS. There are also doughnut graphs with additional breakdowns in terms of users, filetypes and heats which can be scaled by either size or count.\nUsing the GWS Scanner UI \u0026nbsp; Navigate to the GWS Scanner homepage\u0026nbsp; where you should see a Log In button.\nClicking the login button will take you to the login page where you can sign in using your JASMIN account. Upon successful sign-in you should be redirected back to the homepage where you will have the option to view your GWSs\u0026nbsp; .\n\u0026nbsp; At any time, you can click the JASMIN logo in the navbar to return to the homepage. Here you will see a table with the names of your GWSs and their path. Clicking on the path will take you to the tree page for the GWS.\nAlternatively, if you know the path to your GWS you can search for it in the url, e.g. https://gws-scanner.jasmin.ac.uk/tree/\u0026lt;path-here\u0026gt;. On this page you will see the path to your GWS at the top, then the tree graph with the coloured tiles representing folders within the GWS. Note that some larger GWSs may take longer to load.\nThere is a Toggle Patterns button which can be used to swap the coloured tiles for patterned tiles. Hovering over a tile will reveal more information about that folder. There are buttons on the right hand side to scale and colour the tiles by size, count or heat as described earlier. There is also a key showing the values the colour of the tiles correspond to in this sidebar as well as information showing when the GWS was last scanned. Scans usually take around two weeks to complete so each GWS should be scanned approximately fortnightly. There is a Go Up One Level button which will take you back a level, but note that this will only work if you have gone deeper into the file path as it will not show the structure above the root GWS folder. You can click on a tile on the graph to view the tree graph inside that folder. For example, you may have a folder called user1 in group-workspace-1, you could click on this tile to see the structure of the user1 directory then you could use the Go Up One Level button to go back to group-workspace-1. Alternatively, you can just use the back button in your browser to go back. You can keep clicking files to go deeper into the GWS structure until you reach an unindexed children level where there are no more folders, only files. This is represented by a tile saying unindexed children which refers to a collection of files (every level will have an unindexed children tile representing the files within that folder).\nScrolling down the page, you will find the doughnut graphs. There is one for the User Breakdown, Filetype Breakdown and Heat Breakdown. Each of these have coloured sections corresponding to different users, filetypes or heats and the size of them is proportional to the size or count (there are Size and Count buttons to change between them). Again, hovering over a section of the graph will give you more information.\nCommon issues and questions \u0026nbsp; If you get stuck on a loading screen try refreshing the page - we are working on fixing this issue. If you go to the My GWSs\u0026nbsp; page and don\u0026rsquo;t have any GWSs listed, check that your JASMIN account does have access to the GWS you are looking for. Sometimes, if there are lots of tiles they can be hard to read - you can hover over the tile to get the full title or if you want to view the tree graph for that folder, you search for it by URL instead. If you are ever stuck and requiring help, the help beacon can be accessed from any page.

        content: "The instructions below cover the process of logging in using a terminal client only. For a graphical linux desktop, please see alternative instructions using NoMachine NX.\nPreparing your credentials: loading your SSH private key \u0026nbsp; In order to log in using SSH, you need to present your SSH private key as your credential (instead of a username and password). Your private key should reside only on your local machine, so this process of loading your key is something that you do on that local machine. Even if you connect via a departmental server, there should be no need to upload your private key to that machine: the process of loading your key and enabling agent forwarding should ensure that the key is available to subsequent host(s) in the chain of SSH \u0026ldquo;hops\u0026rdquo;.\nThe details of how to do this can vary depending on whether your local machine runs Windows, macOS or Linux.\n\u0026nbsp; See presenting your ssh key for recommended methods to present your SSH key, depending on what type of machine you are using. Once you have set that up successfully, return here and continue below.\nThe JASMIN login servers \u0026nbsp; See this article for a description and listing of the login servers.\nLogging in to JASMIN \u0026nbsp; Assuming that you have loaded your SSH private key using one of the methods described above, then you can login to a login server as follows (do this on your own/local machine):\nssh -A \u0026lt;user_id\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;login_server\u0026gt; For example, user jpax might login to a JASMIN login server with:\nssh -A jpax@login-01.jasmin.ac.uk The -A argument is important because it enables \u0026ldquo;agent-forwarding\u0026rdquo;. This means that your the information about your SSH private key is forwarded to your remote session on the login server so that you can use it for further SSH connections.\nCan\u0026rsquo;t login? \u0026nbsp; Check our troubleshooting guide: login problems The login message \u0026nbsp; When you first login you will see a message that provides some useful information (see Figure 1).\nThe login message shown on login-01.jasmin.ac.uk. X-forwarding for graphical applications (within JASMIN only) \u0026nbsp; Some applications involve displaying graphical output from an application or user interface running on a remote server, typically to display or interact with data graphically. You can instruct your SSH connection to enable forwarding of X-server capability by adding the -X argument to the ssh command, as follows:\nssh -X \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt; Note that the -X argument can be used in conjunction with the agent-forwarding -A argument. In some cases the -Y option may be needed instead of -X.\nPlease note that this arrangement sends your graphical output back to your desktop machine over the network, so should only be used within JASMIN, not to your local desktop machine. A solution has been put in place for a graphical linux desktop environment within JASMIN using NoMachine NX, removing the need to send X11 graphics over the wide-area network. You are strongly advised to use NX for any situation which involves graphical output on JASMIN. Using X11 graphics over the wide-area network outside of JASMIN is not supported: you will not get good performance and this makes inefficient use of shared resources which can impair performance for other users. Please use NX instead. Of course, you may still need to use X11 graphics to send graphical output back to your JASMIN-side graphical desktop within JASMIN, but this is OK as it is all within the JASMIN network.\nWhere next? \u0026nbsp; Having been through all the steps and made an initial connection to JASMIN (well done!) you will be keen to do some real work. You should try the sci servers to get started. Use the list presented on the login screen to select a sci server which is not under heavy usage.\nFor example, from the JASMIN login server, you might choose to login to sci-vm-01:\nssh \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;@sci-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk If you are asked for a password when trying to login to this second machine, it indicates that your ssh key is not being forwarded. Please check that you have used the -A option in your initial connection to the login server, or set up agent forwarding permanently in your SSH client configuration on your local machine.\nThere is no point in trying to enter a password (or even the passphrase associated with your key) as only an ssh key presented in the way described above is accepted.\nNote that once you are logged into a login server then you can omit the \u0026lt;user_id\u0026gt;@ prefix before the server name for the onward connection, since your username will be the same on both systems. But there is no harm in including it anyway, to ensure that you connect as the correct user. As shown above, the -A option is not needed for the onward connection, although there is no harm in including it.\nRemember to log out of the login server in addition to the sci server when you have finished your work, to get back to your own (local) machine:\nexit logout Connection to sci-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk closed. exit logout Connection to login-01.jasmin.ac.uk closed. You are then back on your own machine.\nSee also connecting to a sci server via a login server for some options of different methods for connecting to a sci server."

        content: "This article explains how to submit a batch job to the new scheduler Slurm.\nWhat is a batch job? \u0026nbsp; A batch job is controlled by a script written by the user who submits the job to the batch system Slurm. The batch system then selects the resources for the job and decides when to run the job. Note: the term \u0026ldquo;job\u0026rdquo; is used throughout this documentation to mean a \u0026ldquo;batch job\u0026rdquo;.\nThere are two ways of submitting a job to Slurm:\nSubmit via a Slurm job script - create a bash script that includes directives to the Slurm scheduler Submit via command-line options - provide directives to Slurm via command-line arguments Both options are described below.\nWhich servers can you submit jobs from? \u0026nbsp; Jobs can be submitted to Slurm from any of the sci servers. Check the current list of machines on that page.\nMethod 1: Submit via a Slurm job script \u0026nbsp; The Slurm job submission command is:\nsbatch myjobscript The job script is a Bash script of user\u0026rsquo;s application and includes a list of Slurm directives, prefixed with #SBATCH as shown in this example:\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --partition=short-serial #SBATCH -o %j.out #SBATCH -e %j.err #SBATCH --time=05:00 # executable sleep 5mFor job specification of resources please refer to Table 2 of the help article Slurm quick reference\nMethod 2: Submit via command-line options \u0026nbsp; If you have an existing script, written in any language, that you wish to submit to LOTUS then you can do so by providing Slurm directives as command- line arguments. For example, if you have a script \u0026ldquo;my-script.py\u0026rdquo; that takes a single argument \u0026ldquo;-f \u0026rdquo;, you can submit it using \u0026ldquo;sbatch\u0026rdquo; as follows:\nsbatch -p short-serial -t 03:00 -o job01.out -e job01.err my-script.py -f myfile.txtThis approach allows you to submit jobs without writing additional job scripts to wrap your existing code.\nMethod 3: Submit an interactive session via salloc \u0026nbsp; Testing a job on LOTUS can be carried out in an interactive manner by obtaining a Slurm job allocation or resources (a set of nodes) via the Slurm command salloc . The code/application is executed and the allocation are released after a specific time -default 1 hour - when the testing is finished. There are two ways:\nInteractive execution with pseudo-shell terminal on the compute LOTUS node \u0026nbsp; The job is executed on the LOTUS compute node by invoking the Slurm command srun after allocating resources with salloc. See example below.\nsalloc -p par-single --ntasks-per-node=2 salloc: Pending job allocation 23506 salloc: job 23506 queued and waiting for resources salloc: job 23506 has been allocated resources salloc: Granted job allocation 23506The job allocation ID 23506 has 2 CPUs on the compute node host580 as shown below:\nsqueue -u train001-o\u0026#34;%.18i %.9P %.11j %.8u %.2t %.10M %.6D %.6C %R\u0026#34; JOBID PARTITION NAME USER ST TIME NODES CPUS NODELIST(REASON) 23506 par-singl interactive usertest R 1:32 1 2 host580To launch an interactive shell session on the compute node host580, use the following srun command (from a sci server).\nsrun --pty /bin/bash @host580 ~]$ Interactive execution with no shell \u0026nbsp; A code/application can be executed on the LOTUS compute node without a shell session on the node itself. For example the command \u0026lsquo;hostname\u0026rsquo; is executed twice as there are 2 CPUs and this outputs the name of the node\nsrun hostname host580.jc.rl.ac.uk host580.jc.rl.ac.uk Job array submission \u0026nbsp; Job arrays are groups of jobs with the same executable and resource requirements, but different input files. Job arrays can be submitted, controlled, and monitored as a single unit or as individual jobs or groups of jobs. Each job submitted from a job array shares the same job ID as the job array and is uniquely referenced using an array index. This approach is useful for ‘high throughput\u0026rsquo; tasks, for example where you want to run your simulation with different driving data or run the same processing task on multiple data files.\nImportant note: The maximum job array size that Slurm is configured for is MaxArraySize = 10000. If a Job array of size is greater than 10000 is submitted, Slurm will reject the job submission with the following error message: \u0026ldquo;Job array index too large. Job not submitted.\u0026rdquo;\nTaking a simple R submission script as an example:\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --partition=short-serial #SBATCH --job-name=myRtest #SBATCH -o %j.out #SBATCH -e %j.err #SBATCH --time=30:00 module add jasr Rscript TestRFile.R dataset1.csvIf you want to run the same script TestRFile.R with input file dataset2.csv through to dataset10.csv, you could create and submit a job script for each dataset. However, by setting up an array job, you could create and submit a single job script.\nThe corresponding job array script to process 10 input files in a single job submission would look something like this:\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --partition=short-serial #SBATCH --job-name=myRarray #SBATCH -o %A_%a.out #SBATCH -e %A_%a.err #SBATCH --time=30:00 #SBATCH --array=1-10 module add jasr Rscript TestRFile.R datset$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID.csvHere the important differences are :\nThe array is created by Slurm directive --array=1-10 by including elements numbered [1-10]to represent our 10 variations The error and output file have the array index %a included in the name and %A is the job ID. The environment variable $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID in the Rscript command is expanded to give the job index When the job is submitted, Slurm will create 10 tasks under the single job ID. The job array script is submitted in the usual way:\nsbatch myRarray.sbatchIf you use the squeue -u \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; command to list your active jobs, you will see 10 tasks with the same Job ID. The tasks can be distinguished by the [index] e.g. jobID_index. Note that individual tasks may be allocated to a range of different hosts on LOTUS."

        content: "This article explains the submission of an MPI parallel job to Slurm/ LOTUS.\nWhat is an MPI parallel job? \u0026nbsp; An MPI parallel job runs on more than one core and more than one host using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library for communication between all cores. A simple script, such as the one given below \u0026ldquo;my_script_name.sbatch \u0026quot;\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH -p par-multi #SBATCH -n 36 #SBATCH -t 30 #SBATCH -o %j.log #SBATCH -e %j.err # Load a module for the gcc OpenMPI library (needed for mpi_myname.exe) module load eb/OpenMPI/gcc/4.0.0 # Start the job running using OpenMPI\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;mpirun\u0026#34; job launcher mpirun ./mpi_myname.exe-n refers to the number of processors or cores you wish to run on. The rest of the #SBATCH input options, and many more besides, can be found in the sbatch manual page or in the related articles. You must only use the par- multi queue for parallel jobs using MPI.\nFor those familiar with LOTUS running Platform MPI and Platform LSF, please note that the job is started using the OpenMPI native \u0026ldquo;mpirun\u0026rdquo; command not the \u0026ldquo;mpirun.lotus\u0026rdquo; wrapper script that was previously required. We have provided an mpirun.lotus script for backward compatiblity but it just runs the native mpirun\nTo submit the job, do not run the script, but rather use it as the standard input to sbatch, like so:\nsbatch --exclusive my_script_name.sbatchThe --exclusive flag is used to group the parallel jobs onto hosts which are allocated only to run this job. This ensures the best MPI communication consistency and bandwidth/latency for the job and ensures no interference from other users\u0026rsquo; jobs that might otherwise be running on those hosts.\nMPI implementation and Slurm \u0026nbsp; The OpenMPI library is the only supported MPI library on the cluster. OpenMPI v3.1.1 and v4.0.0 are provided which are fully MPI3 compliant. MPI I/O features are fully supported only on the LOTUS /work/scratch-pw* volumes as these use a Panasas fully parallel file system. The MPI implementation on CentOS7 LOTUS/Slurm is available via the module environment for each compiler as listed below:\neb/OpenMPI/gcc/3.1.1 eb/OpenMPI/gcc/4.0.0 eb/OpenMPI/intel/3.1.1Note: OPenMPI Intel compiler is due shortly as is 4.0.3\nParallel MPI compiler with OpenMPI \u0026nbsp; Compile and link to OpenMPI libraries using the mpif90, mpif77, mpicc, mpiCC wrapper scripts which are in the default unix path. The scripts will detect which compiler you are using (Gnu, Intel) by the compiler environment loaded and add the relevant compiler library switches. For example:\nmodule load intel/20.0.0 module load eb/OpenMPI/intel/3.1.1 mpif90will use the Intel Fortran compiler ifort and OpenMPI/3.1.1. Whereas\nmodule load eb/OpenMPI/gcc/3.1.1 mpiccwill call the GNU C compiler gcc and OpenMPI/3.1.1.\nThe OpenMPI User Guides can be found at https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/\u0026nbsp; ."

In each case, these consist of floating licences shared between JASMIN sci machines and the LOTUS cluster.\n\u0026nbsp; 6 September 2024: IDL v8.9 This version is available but without the full set of run-time licences. This may affect usage, particularly on the LOTUS cluster. This will be resolved in due course. Also please ignore the error message on startup re. GL graphics device. Users are welcome to run multiple instances of IDL code, but for that purpose please make use of the run-time licences by compiling your code using a single development session and then running the pre-compiled code using the -rt flag. An example of this is shown in the next section (below).\nPlease try not to run more than one or two simultaneous IDL development sessions. However, for licence purposes, each unique combination of username, hostname, and $DISPLAY variable counts as a single session. So for example, if you run idl (development mode) in one window, then suspend it with CTRL-Z and start another development session in the same window, this still is only counted as one session by the licence server because the username, hostname, and $DISPLAY are all identical between the two processes. But if you \u0026ldquo;ssh\u0026rdquo; in on two different windows, probably the $DISPLAY will differ between the two windows (e.g. localhost:10 and localhost:11), so if you start idl development sessions in each window they will require separate licences.\nTo see what licences you and others are using, you can use the following sequence of commands:\nmodule add idl/8.5 lmstat -a When interpreting the numbers, note that a single session is counted as 6 licences.\nUsing IDL on LOTUS (via the run-time Licences) \u0026nbsp; IDL run-time licences are available for use on the LOTUS cluster. In order to specify use of the run-time licences please follow the instructions here. You need to compile your IDL code in order to run in run-time mode.\nExample program \u0026nbsp; The example program, \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;, depends on some other functions.\n======== foo.pro ======= pro foo print, doubleit(10) end ======================== ===== doubleit.pro ===== function doubleit, n return, two() * n end ======================== ======= two.pro ======== function two return, 2 end ========================You must save a compiled version of the code in order to run it.\n1. Compile the program:\nCompiles top-level routine only\n.compile foo % Compiled module: FOO. 2. Use resolve_all to compile routines it depends on:\nRecursively search for and compile modules called\nresolve_all % Compiled module: DOUBLEIT. % Compiled module: TWO. 3.

        content: "In addition to the traditional batch computing (LOTUS) and storage (Group Workspaces) services, JASMIN also provides a cloud computing service.\nMany users will already be familiar with cloud services through the use of one of the large public providers (e.g. Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure). The JASMIN Cloud is similar in that it allows an institution or project to consume compute resources as a utility, with no need to provision and maintain the associated physical infrastructure. Users can provision their own virtual machines (VMs) within the JASMIN infrastructure, allowing for greater flexibility. The JASMIN Cloud also allows users to provision clusters for Identity Management, Kubernetes, and Slurm clusters amongst others (see Cluster-as-a-Service).\nThe thing that makes the JASMIN Cloud unique is its colocation with the CEDA Archive and Group Workspaces. The JASMIN Cloud is ideally suited to projects that work with such data, and can enable novel solutions for the manipulation and presentation of data to end-users.\nCloud terminology \u0026nbsp; Different cloud providers have different terms for the users within their cloud and the chunks of resource they have been allocated. In the JASMIN Cloud documentation, we will use the following terminology:\nTenancy: An allocation of resources, i.e. virtual CPUs, RAM and block storage, within the cloud. Tenant: A group (institution or project) that has been allocated a tenancy in the cloud. Tenancy Admin(istrator): The person designated as the administrator of a tenancy. There would usually also be a deputy administrator. JASMIN Cloud Architecture \u0026nbsp; In order to provide as much flexibility as possible for tenants while preserving the security of the system, the JASMIN Cloud is split into two parts (see the schematic below). Both parts of the JASMIN Cloud are administered through the same self-service portal, allowing tenancy admins to provision VMs as required, within the quota of their tenancy.\njasmin cloud achitecture The JASMIN External Cloud is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering, and sits outside of the main JASMIN firewall. Tenants are allowed root access and have complete responsibility for all system administration tasks. This means that tenants are able to provision their own infrastructure (e.g. web portals, remote desktop services), but it also means that tenants are responsible for the security of their machines (e.g. patching, firewall configuration) and for managing their own users. Because it is outside of the JASMIN firewall, tenancies in the External Cloud cannot directly access the JASMIN storage (including PFS, and SOF), and so there is no filesystem level access to the CEDA Archive or Group Workspaces - all access to these data is via the usual external interfaces (i.e. the Object Store, FTP, OpenDAP, HTTP). We also have our Cluster-as-a-Service available to external cloud tenants which is a Platform-as-a-Service offering that tenants can use to deploy clusters including, an identity cluster, storage cluster (NFS), and a Kubernetes cluster.\nExternal Cloud patching policy \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; We expect tenants to react in a timely manner to any security vulnerabilities. This means critical vulnerabilities are patched within 7 days, and high vulnerabilities are patched within 14 days. This is following UKRI security policy. Failure to comply may result in tenancy access being revoked and machines powered down. By contrast, the JASMIN Managed Cloud is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering, sitting inside the main JASMIN firewall, meaning it can reach the JASMIN storage. In order to preserve security, this means that tenants are not allowed root access, and can only deploy VMs from a limited set of pre- approved templates. However, tenants are not responsible for the security of these machines, and users on VMs within the tenancy are JASMIN users. Currently, only two templates are available - an SSH bastion, or login machine, and a Scientific Analysis server with a similar configuration to the shared JASMIN Scientific Analysis servers. The Scientific Analysis servers have the CEDA Archive and Group Workspaces mounted.\nBoth offerings have a similar network structure. Each tenancy has its own local network, where machines have addresses in the 192.168.3.0/24 range - all machines in the tenancy can talk to each other on this network. In addition, each tenancy has an \u0026ldquo;edge device\u0026rdquo;, which is effectively a virtual router. Similarly to your home broadband router, this allows machines within the tenancy to talk to machines outside the tenancy, and ensures packets coming back into the tenancy are forwarded to the correct machine. These \u0026ldquo;edge devices\u0026rdquo; also provide a Network Address Translation (NAT)\u0026nbsp; facility, which allows machines to be allocated an IP address that is visible outside of the tenancy. In the Managed Cloud, this translates to an IP address that is visible on the JASMIN network. In the External Cloud, it translates to an IP address that is visible on the public internet.\nExternal vs. Managed - pros and cons \u0026nbsp; Attribute Managed Cloud External Cloud Self-service provisioning Yes Yes Filesystem level access to JASMIN Storage (PFS, SOF) Yes No Root access No Yes Provision custom infrastructure SSH bastion or Scientific Analysis server only Build from generic Ubuntu or CentOS templates Security and patching Handled by infrastructure team Tenant\u0026rsquo;s responsibility User management JASMIN users Tenant\u0026rsquo;s responsibility Visibility to public internet No Yes (limited number of external IPs) Ability to provision Cluster-as-a-Service No Yes Getting a JASMIN Cloud Tenancy \u0026nbsp; To start a conversation with us about getting a JASMIN Cloud Tenancy for your project, please contact JASMIN Support."

        content: "The JASMIN Notebooks Service provides access to Jupyter Notebooks\u0026nbsp; in a web browser.\nWhat is a Jupyter Notebook? \u0026nbsp; A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive document containing live code and visualisations that can be viewed and modified in a web browser. These documents can be shared, often using GitHub, and many projects distribute example code as Jupyter notebooks. Users interact with their notebooks using the open-source Jupyter Notebook server application.\nJupyter has support for many languages including Python, R, Scala and Julia, which are implemented by plugins known as \u0026ldquo;kernels\u0026rdquo;. The JASMIN Notebook Service currently provides one kernel - Python 3.10 with the latest Jaspy software environment installed. This environment is active by default, so there is no need for the module commands described in the linked article. You can also install and use your own Python environments as explained below.\nThe JASMIN Notebook Service uses JupyterHub\u0026nbsp; to manage multiple Jupyter Notebook servers. After authenticating with a JASMIN account (with the correct access), a user gets access to their own notebook server. The notebook server runs as the authenticated user, and the user can access their home directory, Group Workspaces and CEDA Archive data as they would from a scientific analysis server.\nGetting access to the JASMIN Notebook Service \u0026nbsp; In order to access the JASMIN Notebook service, first, follow the steps in Getting started with JASMIN to get a JASMIN account and the jasmin-login service.\n\u0026nbsp; From 16/6/2021, access to the JASMIN Jupyter Notebook service is controlled simply by having a valid jasmin-login grant. 2-step verification\u0026nbsp; is still required as shown below, but it is no longer necessary to apply for and be granted the additional jupyter-notebooks role, which is now deprecated. Using the JASMIN Notebook Service \u0026nbsp; To use the JASMIN Notebook Service, navigate to https://notebooks.jasmin.ac.uk\u0026nbsp; . This will redirect you to the JASMIN Accounts Portal, where you should sign in with your JASMIN Account. If you have previously accessed the notebook service from the computer you are using, this may happen automatically.\nThe first time you access the JASMIN Notebook Service from a new computer or browser, you will be asked to verify your email address after signing in. To do this, make sure the \u0026ldquo;Email\u0026rdquo; method is selected and click \u0026ldquo;Send me a code\u0026rdquo;:\nSign in with 2-factor authentication This will result in an email being sent to your registered email address containing a six-digit verification code. Enter this code and press \u0026ldquo;Verify code\u0026rdquo;. Each code lasts between 15 and 30 minutes.\nUpon successfully signing in and verifying your email if required, you will be redirected back to the JASMIN Notebook Service. The service will then create a notebook server for you to use, and you will see a loading page:\nLoading page After a few seconds, or in some rare cases a minute or two, you will be taken to the JupyterLab interface:\nJupyterLab interface The folder shown in the left-hand panel will be your home directory on JASMIN, exactly as if you had logged in to a scientific analysis server. Any changes made in JupyterLab will be immediately reflected on the scientific analysis servers and LOTUS, and vice-versa. You can then launch, edit and run Python notebooks using the JupyterLab interface. Notebooks can access files from the CEDA Archive, and also have read-only access to group workspaces. For example, this notebook reads a file belonging to the CCI project from the CEDA Archive and plots the data on a map:\nExample notebook A full discussion of the power of the JupyterLab interface is beyond the scope of this documentation, but the JupyterLab documentation\u0026nbsp; is excellent, and there are many tutorials available on the internet.\nIntended usage and limitations \u0026nbsp; The JupyterLab environment provided by the JASMIN Notebooks Service is powerful, but it has some limitations that reflect the type of usage that we want to encourage.\nThe JASMIN Notebooks Service is primarily intended for interactively producing visualisations of existing data, not for processing vast amounts of data. As such, the resources made available to each notebook server are limited.\nFor larger processing tasks with Notebooks, users should consider using the JASMIN Dask Gateway service\u0026nbsp; , which provides an easy way for processing managed from within a Jupyter Notebook to be scaled out to multiple LOTUS jobs in parallel.\nAlternatively, use the LOTUS batch processing cluster separately, before using the notebooks service to visualise the output.\nDoing this means that the bulk of the resource usage will be shared by the LOTUS cluster rather than the Notebooks service itself.\n\u0026nbsp; Although it was previously the case that Group Workspaces were only available in Notebooks read-only, this is no longer the case (as of 2023), so you should have full read-write access to any group workspace volume. Using the GPU-enabled Notebook Service \u0026nbsp; Please see the JASMIN Notebooks with GPUs enabled page to learn about using Notebooks with GPU access.\nCommon issues and questions \u0026nbsp; I get \u0026ldquo;403 forbidden\u0026rdquo; when I try to access the JASMIN Notebook Service \u0026nbsp; This error occurs when you do not have the correct permissions to access the JASMIN Notebook service. Please ensure you have been granted the jasmin-login and allow some time for the changes to propagate through the system.\nWhich software environment is used by the Notebook Service? \u0026nbsp; The JASMIN Notebook Service currently uses the default Jaspy environment listed on the Jaspy page.\nCan I install additional packages? \u0026nbsp; The recommended way to do this is to create your own virtual environment in the notebooks service and install additional packages into that. You can make that virtual environment persist as a kernel to use again next time you use the Notebooks service.\nIf you believe that the package is more widely applicable, you can request an update to Jaspy.\nCan I use a different software environment? \u0026nbsp; Yes, the article linked above also describes how to use Conda to create your own custom environment.\nI get \u0026ldquo;503 service unavailable\u0026rdquo; when I try to access the JASMIN Notebook \u0026nbsp; Service\nThis error occurs when your notebook server is unable to start. By far the most common cause of this error is when you are over your quota in your home directory. As part of starting up, Jupyter needs to create some small files in your home directory in order to track state. When it is unable to do this because you are over your quota, you will see the \u0026ldquo;503 service unavailable\u0026rdquo; error.\nIf you see this error, try connecting to JASMIN using SSH and checking your home directory usage. After clearing some space in your home directory, your notebook server should be able to start again.\nI get the following message when my notebook is queued for spawning \u0026nbsp; Error message The message above indicates that the Notebook service is oversubscribed -busy- and there are no resources available to start your Notebook server. Please try again later!\nPlease use the scientific analysis server and LOTUS for processing and Jupyter Notebook for lighter visualisation.\nExample Notebooks \u0026nbsp; In support of the JASMIN Notebook Service, we have developed a GitHub repository with a collection of Notebooks that demonstrate some of the important features of the service. The following provides a general introduction:\nhttps://github.com/cedadev/ceda-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/training/intro/notebook-tour.ipynb\u0026nbsp; Other Notebooks can be found within the repository, under:\nhttps://github.com/cedadev/ceda-notebooks/tree/master/notebooks\u0026nbsp; Webinar / video tutorial \u0026nbsp; A CEDA webinar on 16th June 2020\u0026nbsp; demonstrated how to use the service.

        content: "Why do I have to load/activate a software environment? We have a range of different users on JASMIN who work on many different projects. Each project has its own software requirements and timeline. By providing multiple software environments (such as Python2.7 and Python3.7) we can support a wider range of users on the same platform. Since we do not assume a \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; environment it is up to the user to \u0026ldquo;load\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;activate\u0026rdquo;) a software environment before usage. This is typically done by using:\nmodule load \u0026lt;environment\u0026gt; See the overview page for more details.\nHow do I set the Jaspy environment as my default? If you want your JASMIN sessions to automatically use the default \u0026ldquo;jaspy\u0026rdquo; environment then append this line to the end of your \u0026ldquo;$HOME/.bashrc\u0026rdquo; file:\nmodule load jaspy How do I set the `jasmin-sci` environment as my default? If you want your JASMIN sessions to automatically know about the packages in the \u0026ldquo;jasmin-sci\u0026rdquo; environment then add this line to the end of your \u0026ldquo;$HOME/.bashrc\u0026rdquo; file:\nmodule load jasmin-sci How do I activate a combination of Jaspy and `jasmin-sci` environments together? If you want to activate (or load) both the current Jaspy and the \u0026ldquo;jasmin-sci\u0026rdquo; environments at the same time, use:\nmodule load jasmin-sci module load jaspy What is the plan for the future of Jaspy and `jasmin-sci` environments? We have moved over to using Conda\u0026nbsp; as the primary tool for building and deploying software environments. The Jaspy environments are all Conda-based and make use of the significant community efforts supporting scientific computing such as the \u0026ldquo; conda-forge\u0026nbsp; \u0026rdquo; repositories. For some packages, not available through Conda, we have also created the \u0026ldquo;jasmin-sci\u0026rdquo; environment. Ideally, we would like to move to a Conda-only solution in order to simplify both the management and user perspectives. Can I install my own Conda environment? If you need to install a set of packages that are not provided in Jaspy or the \u0026ldquo;jasmin-sci\u0026rdquo; environment then you can create your own Conda installation. It is important to note that this will not be compatible with the Jaspy environments and please take note of the FAQ below: \u0026ldquo;Where should I install software environments on JASMIN?\u0026rdquo;. Where should I install software environments on JASMIN? If you need to install your own software environment(s) on JASMIN then we strongly advise that you install it on one of the SSD file systems:\nUnder your $HOME directory - if you are the only user who needs access. Within a \u0026ldquo;small files\u0026rdquo; Group Workspace - if you wish to share the environment with other JASMIN users. Is MATLAB available on JASMIN? No, MATLAB is not one of our supported software packages and is not installed on JASMIN for general use. As a result, we are not able to provide support for MATLAB-related issues.\nAn alternative is Gnu Octave\u0026nbsp; , which is a ‘drop-in’ replacement for MATLAB, and can be used on LOTUS without license restrictions.\nSome users/groups have arranged their own MATLAB license to be available for use in certain locations on JASMIN, but this is something which users/groups would need to arrange for themselves with the vendor, Mathworks\u0026nbsp; .\nIf you do have your own license, please be aware that any installation of MATLAB would need to be done in a location that meets the terms of the license, and the installation would normally need to be carried out with regular user permissions (JASMIN users do not have root or sudo permissions).\nThere are 2 places where it would be OK to install MATLAB in this case:\nWithin a group workspace, with access restricted to members of the group, but available for use on one of the shared sci machines (but see note below) On a tenancy sci machine: this is a special type of sci server deployed within a JASMIN Cloud tenancy, for exclusive use by members of that tenancy. The manager of the tenancy should do the installation. Safe use of temporary directories if using MATLAB on JASMIN\nBy default, Matlab makes use of the local /tmp area on the machine where it is being used, so if this is on a shared machine, it can fill up the /tmp area and cause issues for all other users of the machine. You are therefore advised to create and use a subdirectory of a group workspace instead of /tmp for your own TMPDIR area. To do this, please do the following (or similar):\nThe following lines added to your $HOME/.bashrc file will set an environment variable TMPDIR, and create the corresponding directory if it does not already exist:\nexport TMPDIR=/gws/\u0026lt;path_to_your_group_workspace\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;your_username\u0026gt;/tmp [ -d $TMPDIR ] || mkdir -p $TMPDIRThis should get automatically set at login, or can be manually invoked with:\n. ~/.bashrc But please note that we are not able to help with MATLAB queries beyond the information provided here."

For event organisers \u0026nbsp; How to request training accounts for your event \u0026nbsp; If you think these accounts could be useful for you, please contact the helpdesk with the following information:\nName/date of event\nEstimated number of attendees (note: we only have 150 such accounts, and events sometimes overlap)\nWhat services the accounts will need access to e.g. sci machines, GWS, CEDA Archive, Notebook Service, Transfer Servers, LOTUS, or any other special services on JASMIN\nAny special requests for accessing resources\nBy default, the training accounts have access to the following services. Any request for other services beyond these would need to be considered by the JASMIN team: Login, nx-login, sci and xfer servers workshop group workspace (/gws/pw/j07/workshop) use of LOTUS via the workshop Slurm queue Jupyter Notebooks service (requires users to set password) Once the JASMIN team have confirmed that we can support your event, you will need to collect and supply the following at least 2 weeks before your event:\nEmail addresses for all attendees who need a training account. These addresses cannot already be associated with an existing JASMIN account. They must be different. Please note that we cannot guarantee the following during your event:\nno login problems uptime of services no problems due to usage at scale (particularly for use of sci servers and/or Notebook Service) What to tell your event attendees \u0026nbsp; The JASMIN team will set up the accounts and send credentials to attendees approximately 1 week before your event.\nPlease ensure you have given the following information to attendees:\nA link to this help page. Tell them all information they need is under the \u0026lsquo;for event attendees\u0026rsquo; section. Tell users what services they have been granted access to (see above) and any additional information e.g. full path to any GWSs, whether they will need to use the JASMIN Notebook Service or accounts portal. Tell the users when the training accounts will be closed down. This is usually within 24 hours of the end of the event. They would be responsible for copying any important data and/or code elsewhere if it is important that these are not lost when the accounts are wiped. For event attendees \u0026nbsp; How to set up your temporary account \u0026nbsp; Training account credentials will be emailed to you via OneDrive. Sometimes the OneDrive email ends up in junk/spam folders, please check here. If you still can\u0026rsquo;t find the email, please contact the helpdesk ASAP. To access the training account credentials, you must: Click on the OneDrive link. Enter your email address (if you already have a JASMIN account, this will be the alternative email address you provided). If you are having difficulty opening the link, please sign out of any alternative OneDrive accounts and then try again. You will then be emailed a verification code. Enter this code on OneDrive. Download the files. These contain your training account credentials. Next, you need to use these training account credentials to set up your own machine for accessing JASMIN. Follow the instructions in Ex00\u0026nbsp; . You MUST do this before your event. You may need access to the JASMIN Notebook Service and Accounts Portal. Your event organiser will let you know whether this is needed for your particular event. If you do need it, you will need to follow the steps in the section below. For the JASMIN Beginners workshop: you do not need this. For the JASMIN Advanced workshop: you do need this. Please follow the steps in the section below. Before the event, familiarise yourself with the JASMIN help documentation site. This should answer most questions you may have. If you are attending a 3rd-party-led event, we suggest taking a look at the other JASMIN workshop training materials\u0026nbsp; - especially if you are a new user. Your event organiser should provide full details of how the training account should be used for that particular event - please contact them if you have any issues.\nJASMIN Notebook Service and Accounts Portal access \u0026nbsp; Access to these services requires a password. This is not sent in the OneDrive link. If you need access to these services, you must:\nGo to the Reset Account Password function of the JASMIN Accounts portal\u0026nbsp; Enter your email address (NB: the one to be used for the training account) You will then receive a password reset email (don’t forget to check your spam folder). Follow- You can now use this new password for accessing the notebook service and the accounts portal."

        content: "\u0026nbsp; Important changes took place in September 2024 affecting what software can be used on JASMIN. Please read this announcement\u0026nbsp; carefully.\nThe information below has been updated in line with this announcement.\nThis page provides details of the \u0026ldquo;Jaspy\u0026rdquo; software environments that provide access to Python 3, R and a range of other tools on JASMIN.\nOverview \u0026nbsp; Jaspy is a toolkit for managing and deploying Conda environments that include Python, R and other packages. Jaspy is used to provide software environments of common packages on the scientific analysis servers and LOTUS cluster on JASMIN.\nOne advantage of Jaspy is that multiple environments can co-exist on the same platform. This allows us to retain previous environments and provide new ones simultaneously. This may be particularly useful for scientists undertaking long-running studies that require a consistent software environment to ensure reproducibility and continuity.\nWorking with Jaspy environments \u0026nbsp; Quickstart for Python 3 environment \u0026nbsp; If you want to get on, you can select a Jaspy environment to \u0026ldquo;activate\u0026rdquo;. This means that once you have run these commands then the various tools and libraries will be available in your current session.\nmodule load jaspy Activating the environment in scripts \u0026nbsp; If you want a particular script to activate a Jaspy environment then add the \u0026ldquo;module\u0026rdquo; command to it, e.g.:\n#!/bin/bash module load jaspy python do-something.py Setting your profile to always use a Jaspy environment \u0026nbsp; If you want all your JASMIN sessions to use a particular Jaspy environment then you can add the module load jaspy command to your $HOME/.bashrc file. In order to avoid issues with using \u0026ldquo;module load\u0026rdquo; on unsupported servers, please wrap the call in an \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; clause, such as:\nif [[ $(hostname) =~ (sci[0-9]|host[0-9]|cylc) ]] ; then module load jaspy fi Discover which environments are available \u0026nbsp; You can list the currently available Jaspy environments using:\nmodule avail jaspy -------------------------------- /apps/jasmin/modulefiles ---------------------------------- jaspy/3.10/v20230718 jaspy/3.11/v20240508 snappy/8.0/jaspy-3.7-r20210320 jaspy/3.11/v20240302 jaspy/3.11/v20240815 (D) This lists all jaspy modules (i.e. environments) that can be loaded.\nJaspy Python (plus other tools) environments \u0026nbsp; The packages available in the Jaspy environments can be found by searching the GitHub repository where the Conda environment files are defined. This table lists all the Jaspy Python 3.7+ environments provided on JASMIN and specifies the current (default) version.\nJaspy Python Environment Versioned list of software packages Default?

This table lists all the Jaspy R environments provided on JASMIN and specifies the current (default) version.\n\u0026nbsp; We are aware of a newly discovered vulnerability in the R Language (CVE-2024-27322) which allows arbitrary code execution from maliciously built RDS (R Data Serialisation) files.\nWe will be updating to the latest version of R as soon as possible to remove this vulnerability, but we do not plan to remove access to R beforehand. Our advice, as always, is to not open data from untrusted sources and not to install untrusted packages from CRAN.\nPlease note that this position may change at short notice as more information becomes available- this notice was last updated on Friday 10th May 2024.\nJaspy R Environment (\u0026ldquo;Jasr\u0026rdquo;) Versioned list of software packages Default? jasr/4.2/v20230718 List of packages including versions\u0026nbsp; No jasr/4.3/v20240320 List of packages including versions\u0026nbsp; No jasr/4.3/v20240815 List of packages including versions\u0026nbsp; Yes The available R environments can be listed with:\nmodule avail jasr Understanding versioning with Jaspy/Jasr \u0026nbsp; Jaspy environments are labelled as \u0026ldquo;jaspy/\u0026lt;python_version\u0026gt;/\u0026rdquo;. The environment is selected and activated using the \u0026ldquo;module load\u0026rdquo; command:\nmodule load jaspy/3.10/v20230718 However, if you wish to get the latest environment for a given Python version you can omit the \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo;, as follows:\nmodule load jaspy/3.10 And if you just want the most up-to-date Python you can even omit the \u0026lt;python_version\u0026gt;, as follows:\nmodule load jaspy \u0026nbsp; If you choose to omit the \u0026lt;release\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;python_version\u0026gt; components then it is important to be aware that the resulting environment may differ over time. For continuity, you ay wish to use the full environment specification. How Jaspy works: managing Python and non-Python packages using conda \u0026nbsp; Jaspy\u0026nbsp; is a framework for managing multiple Python (and other) environments simultaneously on a single platform. It was created in order to meet the requirements tabulated below.\nRequirement Details Jaspy solution Further info Reproducibility 1. Generate a specific set of packages and versions from a generic set of requirements. 1. Conda has a powerful package-management workflow:\na. Begin with a minimal set of package/version requirements.\nb. Generate a consistent environment.\nc. Provide a detailed description of all exact packages/versions in the environment. Conda: https://docs.conda.io\u0026nbsp; jaspy-manager: https://github.com/cedadev/jaspy-manager/blob/master/README.md\u0026nbsp; CEDA jaspy environments: https://github.com/cedadev/ceda-jaspy-envs\u0026nbsp; Documentation Provide an appropriate level of documentation detailing which software packages exist in each release. We use Conda \u0026ldquo;environment files\u0026rdquo; to build the environments. These list the packages and versions and are stored in public GitHub repositories, so each environment is documented as a collection of packages/versions. See: https://github.com/cedadev/jaspy-manager/blob/master/README.md\u0026nbsp; Example package list: https://github.com/cedadev/ceda-jaspy-envs/blob/master/environments/py3.7/m3-4.5.11/jaspy3.7-m3-4.5.11-r20181219/packages.txt\u0026nbsp; Multiple simultaneous environments Allow multiple, but separate, software environments to co-exist on a single operating system. Conda is designed to allow multiple environments to co-exist. Within jaspy it is possible to document each environment. Therefore, multiple environments can be deployed on one system. Key advantages are:\n- Supporting multiple versions of Python and side-by-side.\n- Releasing an update to an environment as a \u0026ldquo;pre-release\u0026rdquo; so that users can adapt their code and test it whilst still having access to the \u0026ldquo;current\u0026rdquo; (production) environment. Manageability Provide tools to easily construct, test, deploy, document and reproduce software environments. Jaspy builds upon a set of excellent Conda command-line tools that simplify the package management process. Jaspy wraps the Conda functionality so that command-line tools can be used to build, test, deploy and distribute Conda environments for use by our community. Updates and tracking of Jaspy/Jasr environments \u0026nbsp; History of environments on JASMIN \u0026nbsp; Please see the Jaspy Python (and other tools) environments section above for information about releases on JASMIN.\nWhich environment is \u0026ldquo;current\u0026rdquo;? \u0026nbsp; Please refer to the Jaspy Python (and other tools) environments section above for information about the current release on JASMIN.\nCiting Jaspy environments \u0026nbsp; Can I cite a jaspy (conda) environment? \u0026nbsp; We do not yet have an agreed approach for citing a Jaspy environment. However, you can refer to the environment description URLs given in the table above. These provide a definitive list of the software packages, their versions and other information.\nRequesting updates to a Jaspy environment \u0026nbsp; If you would like us to add a new package, or an updated version, to the Jaspy environments on JASMIN then please use one of the following approaches:\nContact the JASMIN helpdesk with the subject: \u0026ldquo;Request for Jaspy update: \u0026rdquo; Get a GitHub account and add an issue to the ceda-jaspy-envs repository at: 1. https://github.com/cedadev/ceda-jaspy-envs/issues/new\u0026nbsp; Conda method of \u0026ldquo;activating\u0026rdquo; Jaspy environments \u0026nbsp; Jaspy environments can also be activated in a more traditional way using standard the standard conda approach, for example:\nList the available environments:\nconda info --envs # conda environments: # base * /apps/jasmin/jaspy/miniforge_envs/jaspy3.11/mf3-23.11.0-0 jaspy3.11-mf3-23.11.0-0-v20240302 /apps/jasmin/jaspy/miniforge_envs/jaspy3.11/mf3-23.11.0-0/envs/jaspy3.11-mf3-23.11.0-0-v20240302 jaspy3.11-mf3-23.11.0-0-v20240508 /apps/jasmin/jaspy/miniforge_envs/jaspy3.11/mf3-23.11.0-0/envs/jaspy3.11-mf3-23.11.0-0-v20240508 jaspy3.11-mf3-23.11.0-0-v20240815 /apps/jasmin/jaspy/miniforge_envs/jaspy3.11/mf3-23.11.0-0/envs/jaspy3.11-mf3-23.11.0-0-v20240815 Select one of them, e.g. jaspy3.11-mf3-23.11.0-0-v20240302 and set up to activate it:\nexport PATH=/apps/jasmin/jaspy/miniforge_envs/jaspy3.11/mf3-23.11.0-0/envs/jaspy3.11-mf3-23.11.0-0-v20240302:$PATH source activate conda activate jaspy3.11-mf3-23.11.0-0-v20240302 Prompt changes to:\nThis has the same result as the module load approach. The naming of the environment identifiers includes the \u0026ldquo;miniforge\u0026rdquo; version used to generate the environment. The module load approach is recommended as the standard method for activating Jaspy environments.\nUsing Jaspy beyond JASMIN \u0026nbsp; Jaspy is a versatile and generic tool for managing multiple conda environments. The code is open source, and more information is available at:\nhttps://github.com/cedadev/jaspy-manager\u0026nbsp;"

        content: "\u0026nbsp; A new system called NLDS\u0026nbsp; is in development and will eventually replace both Elastic Tape and JDMA. See the JDMA user documentation at: cedadev.github.io/jdma_client\u0026nbsp; for more information about using JDMA.\nThe joint-storage data migration app (JDMA) is a multi-tiered storage system which provides a single API to users to allow the movement of data to a number of different storage systems, query the data they have stored on those storage systems and retrieve the data.\nThese interactions are carried out using a common user interface, which is a command line tool to be used interactively, a python library or a HTTP API, both to be used programmatically. The command line tool essentially provides a wrapper for calls to the python library, which in turn makes calls to the HTTP API.\nJDMA was designed with the following usability criteria in mind:\nThe user experience for moving data, regardless of the underlying storage systems, should be identical. The user should not be responsible for maintaining the connection to the storage system in the case of asynchronous transfers. User and group ownership and permissions should be preserved and restored on downloading the data The user should receive notifications when the transfers are complete. Users should be able to transfer data from one storage system to another JDMA is only a request and query layer. Any cataloguing of data should be carried out by the backend system. So that, if JDMA fails, then the data is still available independently of JDMA, from the storage backend. See the JDMA user documentation at: cedadev.github.io/jdma_client/\u0026nbsp; for more information about using JDMA.\nJDMA was development under a Horizon 2020 grant from the EU Commission. A report submitted to the EU Commission can be found in the repository at: [github.com/cedadev/django-jdma_control/blob/master/doc/ESiWACE- Milestone-8_final.pdf]( https://github.com/cedadev/django-\u0026nbsp; jdma_control/blob/master/doc/ESiWACE-Milestone-8_final.pdf)\nThe JDMA client github is at: github.com/cedadev/jdma_client\u0026nbsp; Quick guide to installing the JDMA client on JASMIN \u0026nbsp; If you are working on JASMIN and you wish to use the JDMA client, then you can install it as follows on a sci server:\nmodule load jaspy python -m venv ~/venvs/jdma-venv source ~/venvs/jdma-venv/bin/activate pip install git+https://github.com/cedadev/jdma_client You should then have the jdma command-line tool available in your terminal session.\n\u0026nbsp; In August 2024 the JDMA server was upgraded to a new operating system. This requires an upgraded JDMA client to be installed. If you were using JDMA prior to August 2024 then you will have to upgrade your client. This is a straightforward process of three steps, shown below:\nActivate the virtual environment as above: Install the upgraded JDMA client: Check the version of the JDMA client: The correct version is 1.0.1\nsource ~/jdma_venv/bin/activate pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/cedadev/jdma_client pip list | grep jdma-client"

        content: "Having problems connecting to a host on JASMIN? Details of how to login to JASMIN can be found here, but this article may help to resolve login problems. It provides information for the following issues:\nUnable to login to a login server Can login to login server but can\u0026rsquo;t login to a subsequent server ssh-add command gives error: \u0026ldquo;Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.\u0026rdquo; Errors when trying to connect with MobaXterm Unable to login to login server \u0026nbsp; If you are unable to login to a login server e.g. login-01.jasmin.ac.uk then look carefully at any error messages displayed as this can help diagnose what is wrong:\n1) \u0026ldquo;Connection reset by peer\u0026rdquo;\nThis suggests a problem with the configuration of your machine or local network. We no longer restrict access to JASMIN by network domain, and no longer require registration of non-*.ac.uk domains, so you should be able to connect from anywhere. If your local admin team is not able to resolve the issue, please contact JASMIN support.\n2) \u0026ldquo;Permission denied\u0026rdquo;\nHere, the most likely cause is that the SSH key which your client is presenting does not match the one in your JASMIN account. This can be for a number of reasons:\nYour SSH client is old and needs updating You can check this with ssh -V and comparing to the versions mentioned here. You will need to update your client before you can connect to JASMIN securely. Ask your local admin team for help: this is not something that we can \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo; at the JASMIN end. You have omitted to specify the username in your SSH connection In this case, you will be attempting to connect with the username you have on your local machine, which may not be the same. You have only recently uploaded your SSH key (it can take 20 to 60 minutes before the key propagates to all the places it needs to on JASMIN). Try waiting a few minutes before trying again. You don\u0026rsquo;t have your key loaded in your local authentication agent (e.g. ssh-agent). Check that you are following the method suitable for your operating system The article \u0026ldquo; How to login\u0026rdquo; has instructions for linux, mac and windows. Note that connections using NoMachine NX don\u0026rsquo;t require an authentication agent: this can be a good alternative if you\u0026rsquo;re having problems. You have not yet been granted jasmin-login access or your access has expired. To check, go to My services\u0026nbsp; on the JASMIN accounts portal and check that \u0026ldquo;Login services: jasmin-login\u0026rdquo; is listed. If not then you either need to apply for jasmin-login access\u0026nbsp; , or if you have already done this recently you may simply need to wait for it to be approved. Note that if you have applied for access to a group workspace you still need jasmin-login access in order to connect to jasmin machines. 3) \u0026ldquo;The authenticity of host \u0026rsquo;nnnn ( )\u0026rsquo; can\u0026rsquo;t be established.\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;key for host nnnn has changed\u0026rdquo;\nYour local computer stores a list of all the other SSH hosts which it has successfully connected to in the past. If you use an intermediate host like a login server to make onward connections to a sci machine, the login host will maintain another such list. In both cases there should be a file~/.ssh/known_hosts (so one in your local home directory on your own machine, and one in your JASMIIN home directory)\nWhen the SSH client first contacts the host for the SSH connection, it checks to see if the remote host is one that it recognises. If this check fails, you may get a message like the following:\nMessage 1:\nThe authenticity of host \u0026#39;nnnn (\u0026lt;ip address\u0026gt;)\u0026#39; can\u0026#39;t be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:8QY9iBcOQFyEYkpOtBUU8WQGeADb0DyMff01BRuvYls. ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:f9:19:c4:5f:2b:fa:ed:aa:34:86:c9:23:dd:1c:44:30.

Add correct host key in /home/users/username/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message. Offending ECDSA key in /home/users/username/.ssh/known_hosts:115 ECDSA host key for nnnn has changed and you have requested strict checking. Host key verification failed. This can happen when:\nmachines are re-installed (as part of maintenance by the JASMIN team) when you modify your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file when you access a \u0026ldquo;known\u0026rdquo; host but via a different name (e.g. sci-vm-01 vs sci-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk) Message 1 means that you don\u0026rsquo;t have an entry for that host in your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. In most cases, you can safely reply \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; and the SSH connection should proceed as normal from then on.\nIf you get message 2, and are confident that the change is for a legitimate reason, the solution is to modify your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, removing the entries for that host (there may be more than one, as above for sci1 vs sci-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk) by deleting those lines. Next time you try and connect, you will get message 1, but can reply \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; and the SSH connection should proceed as normal.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re using a graphical SFTP or SCP client for data transfers, the error messages above may be hidden and so it can be harder to establish the reason for failure. Using a terminal session (in MobaXterm on Windows, or Mac/Linux terminal) to the problem host will likely reveal the messages and enable you to follow the steps above to solve the problem.\nCan login to login server but can\u0026rsquo;t login to a subsequent host \u0026nbsp; Here, there are 3 main possibilities:\n1) You have not set up agent forwarding correctly on your local machine.\n****This allows your ssh key to be used for logging in from the login server to other machines. To check, run the following command on the login server:\necho \u0026#34;$SSH_AUTH_SOCK\u0026#34; This should display something that looks similar to (but not identical to)\n/tmp/ssh-RNjiHr2844/agent.2844 If nothing is displayed then it indicates that agent forwarding is not working. Please read how to login and make sure you are running ssh-agent (or similar), have loaded your private key and are using the -A option on your ssh command for the connection to the login server. NX users should make sure that the \u0026ldquo;agent forwarding\u0026rdquo; option is ticked when setting up a connection profile.\n2) Some hosts within JASMIN are restricted to particular (groups of) users.\nThe sci servers and xfer servers should be available to all with jasmin-login access (see above). Where you need special access to a particular service, this will be indicated in the relevant documentation on this site.

The sci servers (particularly physical/high-memory hosts sci-ph-[12]) experience very high usage loads and occasionally run out of resources. This may prevent you from logging in. In some circumstances ask you for a password: this is normally a sign that something is wrong with the machine, since passwords are not used for SSH logins on JASMIN, so there is no point in trying to enter your account password or SSH passphrase at this stage. In this case please contact the JASMIN helpdesk.\nIf you still have problems then please contact us using the help beacon below. It would be helpful if you can include as much of the following information as possible:\nThe IP address and full hostname of the machine you are trying to connect from. The date and time that you tried connecting (to the nearest minute if possible). This will help us to identify any relevant messages in any log files. The exact command you were using Add -vvv to your ssh command and send us the the output (please include the command itself) List the SSH keys directory on your local machine. On a linux machine this can be done with the command: ls -l ~/.ssh ssh-add command gives error: \u0026ldquo;Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.\u0026rdquo; \u0026nbsp; On some terminal sessions the usual instructions for starting the ssh-agent session and adding the key may give the following error:\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin Could not open a connection to your authentication agent. If you get this message, please try either:\nmodifying the method you use to start the ssh-agent, to:\neval $(ssh-agent -s) (and then trying to load the key again)\nor see below (if using MobaXterm) which now has a better way of loading the SSH key.\nErrors when connecting with Mobaxterm \u0026nbsp; Please follow the instructions for MobaXterm (which include a video to show how to load your key into its own ssh-agent, MobAgent).\nThese instructions have changed with more recent versions of MobaXterm, and replace the need to use the ssh-add command, so please make sure that both the version you are using, and your method, are up to date!\nPlease note that even if your initial connection to (for example) your university host does not require your JASMIN SSH key, you should still load the key AND enable agent forwarding, for your initial connection to that host, so that the key can be used for the subsequent connection to the JASMIN login host. This actually applies to any connection method, not just MobaXterm."

        content: "This article gives an overview of the LOTUS batch computing cluster which is part of JASMIN. It covers:\nWhat LOTUS is and what it can be used for Where LOTUS can be accessed from What is LOTUS \u0026nbsp; LOTUS is not, in itself, a High-Performance Computing (HPC) facility, but provides the batch and parallel processing component of the JASMIN data- intensive scientific analysis environment. LOTUS is a cluster of physical machines, running the Slurm workload manager, enabling efficient scheduling of larger data analysis tasks across nodes in the cluster as a single unit -see Figure 1.\nEach node in the cluster is connected by 10Gbit/s Ethernet to JASMIN\u0026rsquo;s high-performance 40Gbit/s core network. Although not its primary function, LOTUS also facilitates MPI-based parallel processing.\nJASMIN provides both interactive and batch computing environments, recognising that scientists often need to develop and test workflows interactively before running those workflows efficiently at scale. Nodes within LOTUS run the same stack of software and can access the same high- performance storage as the JASMIN Scientific Analysis servers, ensuring a consistent working environment for all phases of users\u0026rsquo; workflows.\nSee LOTUS Hardware for details of the current LOTUS environment summarised in this schematic presentation\nFigure 1 shows a schematic presentation of the LOTUS cluster and its environment\nLOTUS schematic When to use LOTUS \u0026nbsp; LOTUS is ideally suited to workflows which need to process or compare entire datasets, stored either in Group Workspaces or in the CEDA archives. The latter are directly accessible read-only so can be processed in-place without the need to copy files. Intermediate working files (within batch jobs) should be stored temporarily in /work/scratch-pw* and /work/scratch-nopw* volumes which are shared across the cluster, while persistent outputs can be written efficiently to Group Workspaces and shared with collaborators for the duration of a project.\nSee Access to Storage for details about which file systems are appropriate to use and how to access them.\nLOTUS currently has around 19,000 cores, but is heavily used and implements a fair-share scheduling system between users. It is not intended as a substitute for dedicated HPC facilities, rather as a complementary environment in which model outputs can be analyzed and compared with observational data. Users with large-scale compute-heavy requirements (in particular those requiring large- scale parallel processing) should look to access other parts of the national HPC infrastructure such as ARCHER2\u0026nbsp; or MONSooN\u0026nbsp; .\nIn order to maintain a safe and reliable working environment for all within LOTUS and more widely within JASMIN, users are expected to follow the best practice outlined in this documentation.\nHow to gain access to LOTUS \u0026nbsp; LOTUS is accessible via the Slurm batch scheduler that is available to use from all JASMIN scientific analysis servers.\nFrom the above servers, it is possible to submit, monitor, and control batch jobs using the Slurm commands.\nPlease note that if you have only recently requested access to JASMIN login services and had this approved, there can sometimes be a delay (typically up to a day, but in rare cases can be longer) before the necessary configuration is created for you on LOTUS. You will not be able to submit jobs to LOTUS queues until this has been completed. Typically you would see an error message such as this, in this case after an unsuccessful attempt to submit to the short-serial queue:\nsbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specifiedIf this occurs, please try again in 24 hours before contacting the JASMIN helpdesk."

        title: "Managing a GWS",
        description: "Managing a GWS",
        
        
        content: "This article explains the responsibilities of the Group Workspace (GWS) manager.\nRole of the GWS Manager \u0026nbsp; When a GWS is created it is important that the designated GWS Manager understands the responsibilities associated with the role. The GWS Manager has a duty to:\nEnsure that GWS is being used appropriately: this may include enforcement of limits on particular users. Advertise the URL for requesting access to the GWS. Respond to e-mail authorisation requests from CEDA. Manage disk and tape effectively: specifically the use of the Elastic Tape system to back-up or migrate data. Communicate GWS etiquette to the project scientists. Manage additional services such as sharing of GWS data via HTTP server. Manage the closing down of the GWS effectively: all GWSs have a termination date and data may be lost if not managed effectively. Communicate any issues to the CEDA Helpdesk. Managing users \u0026nbsp; Authorising access to the GWS \u0026nbsp; When your GWS has been set up, users can submit requests for access to the GWS via the JASMIN accounts portal: the new GWS will appear in the list of JASMIN Services\u0026nbsp; . An access request from a user will trigger an e-mail to you that asks you to approve (or refuse) the request. The e-mail will include details of the user and their intended use of the resource. As GWS manager, you are now responsible for approving these requests (this is a change from the previous situation where you confirmed your approval to the CEDA helpdesk who then actioned the approval). Now the approval is instant.\nIMPORTANT: in order for this approval process to work, the GWS manager\u0026rsquo;s own account needs to have been migrated to the JASMIN accounts portal if it existed prior to the JASMIN Accounts Portal in 2017. Very few accounts such now remain in that state, but you can check by going to this page:\nMigrate your account\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; If it says \u0026ldquo;You are already logged in with a JASMIN account\u0026rdquo; then you need take no further action.\nFile system permissions and groups \u0026nbsp; File system access to a GWS is managed using a Unix group that begins with gws_ and normally corresponds with the name of the service in the Accounts Portal. When users are granted the USER role for the workspace, they are also made members of the corresponding gws_\u0026lt;gwsname\u0026gt; group. As manager, you are normally granted USER and MANAGER access at the time that the GWS is set up by the JASMIN team, so it should be in place when you first access the storage. This means that:\nyou have access yourself to the workspace (via the USER role giving you membership of the gws_\u0026lt;gwsname\u0026gt; group) you take over responsibility (via the MANAGER role) for approving other users\u0026rsquo; applications for the USER role. you can unilaterally grant DEPUTY access to other users if you know their username and want them to help you in the task of approving requests for USER access. Once you yourself have access, a good first task is to set up the recommended directory structure.\nA list of the user IDs that have access to a given GWS can be found by using the \u0026ldquo;getent group\u0026rdquo; command and piping it through \u0026ldquo;grep\u0026rdquo; to select only your GWS. For example:\ngetent group | grep gws_cedaproc gws_cedaproc:*:26015:fbloggs,jdoe You can lookup a specific user ID with the following:\ngetent passwd | grep fbloggs fbloggs:*:29775:26030:Fred Bloggs:/home/users/fbloggs:/bin/bash Maintaining group permissions throughout the GWS \u0026nbsp; In order to maintain the group permissions throughout the GWS the highest level directory has the \u0026ldquo;sticky bit\u0026rdquo; set. This means that the default group for all files and directories created within the GWS will be the relevant gws_* access group. This is particularly useful to enable data within the GWS to be shared amongst collaborators. If users have a specific need to modify the group permissions they can do so using \u0026ldquo;chgrp\u0026rdquo; command.\nMaking directory contents writable by other members of the GWS \u0026nbsp; If a user wishes to make their files/directories writable by others in the GWS they can follow the procedure here using the \u0026ldquo;umask\u0026rdquo; command:\nMake a directory (and set it the permission so that the group can read/write to it):\nmkdir --mode=u+rwx,g+rws,o-rwx testdir ls -l testdir drwxrws--- 2 jdoe gws_cedaproc 4096 Jan 26 14:36 testdir Or (as separate steps):\nmkdir testdir chgrp g+rws testdir chgrp o-rwx testdir ls -l testdir drwxrws--- 2 jdoe gws_cedaproc 4096 Jan 26 14:36 testdir However, please also see security, below (and make sure your users are aware of this).\nCheck your umask:\numask 0022 Modify your \u0026ldquo;umask\u0026rdquo; so that any new file or directory that you create will be writable anyone with the group permission:\numask 002 touch testdir/newfile ls -l testdir -rw-rw-r-- 1 jdoe gws_cedaproc 0 Jan 26 14:39 newfile If you want the umask setting to persist, you should set it for yourself in your ~/.bashrc file, and advise your users to do the same.\nQuota, resource allocation and GWS lifetime \u0026nbsp; The overall usage of a GWS can be determined with the df (SOF) or pan_df (PFS) command:\npan_df -H /gws/pw/j07/workshop/ Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on panfs://panmanager03.jc.rl.ac.uk/gws/pw/j07 2.6T 16G 2.6T 1% /gws/pw/j07/workshop/ df -H /gws/nopw/j04/ncas_generic Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on quobyte@sds.jc.rl.ac.uk/gws_ncas_generic 83T 80T 3.4T 96% /gws/nopw/j04/ncas_generic For PFS (paths beginning /gws/pw/j07/*), the raw capacity of the GWS is 2.6TB (measured in TB, defined using powers of 10), but to obtain space available to users this should be divided by roughly 1.3, resulting in around 2TB of free space. Of this, 16GB is currently in use. The factor of 1.3 can depend on the number of small files stored in the GWS because lots of small files take up more space than expected.\nFor SOF (paths beginning /gws/nopw/j04/*), the value reported by df -H is the usable size.\nA summary of specific sections of a GWS can be determined using pan_du -sh \\\u0026lt;di\\r\u0026gt; (PFS), and du -sh --si --apparent-size \\\u0026lt;dir\\\u0026gt; (SOF). Set the --apparent-size flag to get an accurate size.\nSimilarly, you can use the find command together with -atime or -mtime to locate files accessed or modified more than a certain length of time ago. For example, to find files which were accessed more than 1 year ago:\nfind /gws/nopw/j04/upscale/cache -type f -atime +365However, this can\nconsume significant system resources in running the du command, for a long time, and fail due to permission issues (as a regular user, you can\u0026rsquo;t always \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; down all the directory branches) \u0026hellip;So we provide some tools to help with this:\nThe GWS Scanner runs this for you, centrally, on a roughly 2-week cycle, and stores all the output in a database from which results can be visualised in the GWS Scanner User Interface.\nThere is also a live view of GWSs and the available space left on the JASMIN Dashboard\u0026nbsp; . The “JASMIN Storage” tab shows many JASMIN storage volumes with information about current usage.\nSo please don\u0026rsquo;t run large du or find jobs yourself, as this will be duplicating something already running in the background.\nAs a GWS Manager you will receive e-mails summarising the usage and contents of the GWS. If you wish for additional directories to be scanned and summarised please add these to the GWS scanner configuration.\nThe typical lifetime of a GWS is 3 years. All GWS managers are expected to actively manage the space during its lifetime and plan for the eventual reclamation of the space by deleting and migrating data to other locations. Typically, less-frequently-used data might be written to Elastic Tape (see below) and some final outputs would be curated in the CEDA Archive. In the latter case please note that you should discuss the requirements with the CEDA Archive team via the CEDA Helpdesk, ideally before the project starts.\nMigrating data to tape \u0026nbsp; Proactive data management is an important part of providing an effective GWS. We recommend that the GWS Manager discusses use of the space with the project team to ensure that the use of disk and tape are being optimised. This may involve use of the Elastic Tape system for backup or data migration (from disk to tape).\nRequesting a change to the GWS size \u0026nbsp; Although it is helpful to provide the best estimate of required allocation at the time of initially requesting the GWS, a GWS Manager may request a change in size (increase or decrease) of the GWS during its lifetime. We would positively encourage you to be honest about your requirements so that others can make use of this expensive resource if you are not using it until later in your project, or if you no longer require all the space you originally requested.\nRequests for an increase in GWS size will be considered by the Consortium Manager with responsibility for managing an overall allocation to that particular scientific community. See Requesting Resources. Depending on available resources and competing demand, it may not always be possible to increase the allocation, and you may be asked to move data to Elastic Tape to free up disk space.\nSecurity \u0026nbsp; User account security is very important in a multi-user environment such as JASMIN. As a GWS Manager you have a responsibility to users of your GWS but also to all other GWS users in helping to maintain a safe and secure system in which productive scientific work can be done. There is a strict policy of one- user-one-key, and on no account must any user make use of the SSH key of another user to gain access to any part of the JASMIN infrastructure. Private keys MUST be protected by a strong passphrase. Please encourage adherence to these rules by users of your GWS. Any infringements may be dealt with swiftly by removal of user access. No offensive, obscene or otherwise unauthorised data may be stored in the GWS or anywhere else within JASMIN. Users should not store any data of a personal or sensitive nature in the GWS.\n\u0026nbsp; Do not set, or allow your users to set, open permissions on files or directories. By this we mean permissions where data are \u0026ldquo;world-writable\u0026rdquo; by anyone, for example\n-rw-rw-rw- for a file, or \u0026laquo; DON\u0026rsquo;T USE THESE!!\ndrwxrwxrwx for a directory. \u0026laquo; OR THESE!!\nWe provide a UNIX a group corresponding to each group workspace, which all members of that GWS belong to: this enables sharing within the group if you set permissions appropriately using that group. If you are unsure about setting permissions, please ask the helpdesk.\nChanging ownership of files in your GWS \u0026nbsp; Sometimes, it is necessary for GWS managers or deputies to take ownership of files in their GWS which are owned by other users, for example to delete them, or move them to other storage. Often this is necessary when a previous member of a GWS no longer uses JASMIN.\nJASMIN now has a command-line tool, gwschown, which allows managers or deputies to do this without assistance of the helpdesk. This tool is installed on the sci servers, and allows GWS managers and deputies to change the ownership of files and directories in their group workspace.\nThe command provides usage information via the -h or --help option, as shown:\ngwschown --help usage: gwschown [-h] [-R] [-v] [-n] [--no-warn] user path [path ...] Changes ownership of files and directories in a group workspace. positional arguments: user the user who will become the owner of the files path path to the file(s) to change the ownership of optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -R, --recursive operate on files and directories recursively -v, --verbose output a diagnostic for every file processed -n, --dry-run check permissions but do not actually run chown (implies -v) --no-warn run without prompting for confirmation For example, replace exampleuser with the username of the user who will take ownership of the files, and substituting in your own path. A good idea is to run it with --dry-run first just to check everything is working.\ngwschown exampleuser /gws/nopw/j04/workshop/myfile --dry-run As with chown, you can also operate recursively on directories with the -R flag. This tool will only work in group workspaces where you have the MANAGER or DEPUTY role.\nIf you wish to change the group of files or directories, you should first use the tool to change the ownership to your user- you will then be able to change the group in the usual way using chgrp.\nKeeping informed \u0026nbsp; Please maintain contact throughout the life of the GWS via the following channels:\nCEDA Status Board\u0026nbsp; with live updates on incidents affecting CEDA and JASMIN services. JASMIN Dashboard\u0026nbsp; to check on the status of your GWS (used versus available space). Email alerts from the system when the GWS reaches \u0026gt;83% full Email from the CEDA/JASMIN team News articles on the CEDA\u0026nbsp; or JASMIN\u0026nbsp; websites. If you are aware that a user who has access to your GWS leaves your project or, for whatever reason, no longer needs to be a member of the GWS, please let the JASMIN Helpdesk know either by email or via the beacon, lower right on this page. Arrangements may need to be made to transfer the ownership of files and/or directories to another member of the GWS to ensure continued access to the data."

        description: "Software and operating system changes - migration to Rocky Linux 9 (Summer 2024)",
        
        
        content: "\u0026nbsp; Lots of updated information below about the new Rocky Linux 9 environment on JASMIN: please read, and keep checking back here regularly for now. Introduction \u0026nbsp; As with a previous migration completed in 2020, the change of operating system version is needed to make sure that the version in use is current and fully supported, i.e. that package updates are available and important security updates can be obtained and applied to keep the platform secure.\nThe current operating system, CentOS7 is officially end-of-life as of the end of June 2024. We will be moving from CentOS7 to Rocky Linux 9, which is supported until May 2032. Rocky 9 should provide a very similar user experience to that provided by CentOS7, but with more recent software packages. Some software may have been removed or replaced during this transition.\nThis change affects JASMIN and CEDA services in several ways, including but not limited to the following:\nComponents of all CEDA Archive and JASMIN web-based services need to be redeployed User-facing service hosts (e.g. login/sci/xfer and LOTUS nodes) all need to be redeployed All of these hosts need appropriate versions of drivers for various hardware and infrastructure components (e.g. storage, network, …) to be configured. The Slurm scheduler used for the LOTUS and ORCHID clusters needs to be adapted to work under Rocky 9, in terms of its own management functions and the worker nodes which it controls. A separate announcement will cover the expansion of LOTUS with new processing nodes: these will be introduced as a new cluster under Slurm, with existing nodes moved from old to new as part of the transition. There will be a limited window in which the 2 clusters will co-exist, during which time the old cluster will shrink in size: the current estimate for this is between July to September 2024, but we will provide updates on this as the new hardware is installed and timescales become clearer. We will endeavour to provide sufficient overlap and temporary arrangements to help users to migrate their workflows. Software made available centrally via the module system and under /apps needs to be made available in versions compatible with Rocky 9. Some software may need to be recompiled. Other software (e.g. run by users or groups, without being centrally managed) may need to be tested and in some cases recompiled in order to work correctly under Rocky 9. Management and monitoring systems need to be updated to operate in the new environment For tenants of the JASMIN Cloud, you should already be aware of our plans to move to use the STFC Cloud as the base platform for the JASMIN Cloud Service. Images are currently in preparation so that new (empty) tenancies will soon be available for tenants to manage the migration of their own virtual machines over to new instances using Rocky 9 images. It is anticipated at this stage that managed tenancies (with tenancy sci machines) will be discontinued as part of this move, so users of those VMs will be advised to use the new Rocky 9 general-use sci servers instead. Much of this work is already underway by teams in CEDA and STFC’s Scientific Computing Department. As a result of extensive work by these teams in recent years to improve the way services are deployed and managed, we are now in a much better position to undertake this kind of migration with as little disruption to users as possible. Some disruption and adaptation by users will be inevitable, however.\nSome services have already been migrated and are already running under Rocky 9, but there is still much work to be done over the coming weeks so please watch this space as we do our best to keep you informed of the progress we’re making, and of any actions you may need to take to minimise disruption to your work on JASMIN.\n\u0026nbsp; Please find below details of the new Rocky 9 environment on JASMIN. We will update other documentation to match this in due course, but the information below will be the most up-to-date source until further notice. Details of the new Rocky Linux 9 environment \u0026nbsp; General \u0026nbsp; The move to Rocky Linux 9 (abbreviated to \u0026ldquo;Rocky 9\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;R9\u0026rdquo; from here on) involves many changes at lower levels transparent to users, so we will focus here on those most relevant to how services on JASMIN are accessed and used. The reasons for the choice of Rocky 9 itself, and for some of the associated changes to software, machines and services provided, will not be covered in detail, but have been influenced by a number of factors including:\norganisational security and maintenance policies availability of packages and dependencies for the chosen operating system user feedback Login nodes \u0026nbsp; The list of new login nodes is as follows:\nname status login-01.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; ready to use login-02.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; ready to use login-03.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; ready to use login-04.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; ready to use Notes:\nThere is no longer any requirement for forward/reverse DNS lookup or any restriction by institutional domain. You no longer need to register non-*.ac.uk domains with the JASMIN team (exception: hpxfer) This means all users can access all login servers (previously some users could only use login2) As before, no filesystems other than the home directory are mounted. Use only as a \u0026ldquo;hop\u0026rdquo; to reach other servers within JASMIN. Make sure your SSH client is up to date. Check the version with ssh -V. If it\u0026rsquo;s significantly older than OpenSSH_8.7p1, OpenSSL 3.0.7, speak to your local admin team as it may need to be updated before you can connect securely to JASMIN. NX login nodes \u0026nbsp; name status nx1.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready for use, update your SSH key nx2.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready for use, update your SSH key nx3.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready for use, update your SSH key nx4.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready for use, update your SSH key Notes:\nUpdated advice for connection, requires updating your SSH key. New nodes have identical configuration so are accessible from all network locations (no further need for some users to use only certain nodes). By keeping the host names as short as possible, we mitigate the issue some users (with long usernames created before the 8-character rule) had with agent forwarding: all should behave the same as the old nx4 in this respect. As before, no filesystems other than the home directory are mounted. Use only with the NoMachine Enterprise Client to get a graphical Linux desktop, from where you can use the Firefox browser on the linux desktop to access web resources only accessible within JASMIN make onward connections to a sci server for using graphics-intensive applications Make sure you are using the most up-to-date version of NoMachine Enterprise Client\u0026nbsp; . sci servers \u0026nbsp; We have introduced a new naming convention which helps identify virtual and physical/high-memory sci servers. The new list is as follows:\nname status specs slurm cluster Virtual servers sci-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready to use 24 CPU / 64 GB RAM / 80 GB (virtual disk) old sci-vm-02.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready to use 24 CPU / 64 GB RAM / 80 GB (virtual disk) old sci-vm-03.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready to use 24 CPU / 64 GB RAM / 80 GB (virtual disk) old sci-vm-04.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready to use 24 CPU / 64 GB RAM / 80 GB (virtual disk) old sci-vm-05.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready to use 24 CPU / 64 GB RAM / 80 GB (virtual disk) old Physical servers sci-ph-01.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready to use 48 CPU AMD EPYC 74F3 / 2 TB RAM / 2 x 446 GB SATA SSD new sci-ph-02.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready to use 48 CPU AMD EPYC 74F3 / 2 TB RAM / 2 x 446 GB SATA SSD new sci-ph-03.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; Ready to use 192 CPU AMD EPYC 9654 / 1.5 TB RAM / 480 GB SATA SSD + 800 GB NvMe SSD new Notes:\nFor users within the STFC network, there is no longer any reverse DNS restriction. Replacements for common tools: lxterminal has been replaced with xfce-terminal\u0026nbsp; for a more richly-featured editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE), users should consider using the remote editing features of VSCode\u0026nbsp; or PyCharm\u0026nbsp; , since these can be installed and customised locally by the user to their taste rather than needing central installation and management on JASMIN. Watch this space for further advice about how to configure and use VSCode in this way. See jaspy, jasr and jasmin-sci sections below for further information on software. For graphical applications, use the NoMachine NX service rather than sending X11 graphics over the network back to your laptop/desktop, to ensure performance. X11 graphics functionality is still to be added to these machines (coming shortly), but currently this will fail with an error like: xterm: Xt error: Can\u0026#39;t open display: xterm: DISPLAY is not set As before, physical servers are actually re-configured nodes within the LOTUS cluster and as such have different a network configuration from the virtual sci servers, with limited outward connectivity. xfer servers \u0026nbsp; name status notes xfer-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; ready to use Virtual server xfer-vm-02.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; ready to use Virtual server xfer-vm-03.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; ready to use Virtual server, has cron. Notes:\nSimilar config on all 3 (no domain or reverse DNS restrictions now) Same applies re. SSH client version, see login nodes If using cron on xfer-vm-03, you must use crontamer Throttle any automated transfers to avoid many SSH connections in quick succession, otherwise you may get blocked. Consider using Globus for any data transfer in or out of JASMIN A new software collection jasmin-xfer has now been added to these servers, providing these tools: emacs-nox ftp lftp parallel python3-requests python3.11 python3.11-requests rclone rsync s3cmd screen xterm hpxfer servers \u0026nbsp; name status notes hpxfer3.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; ready to use Physical server hpxfer4.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026nbsp; ready to use Physical server Notes:\nTested with sshftp (GridFTP over SSH) from ARCHER2 Same applies re. SSH client version, see login nodes The software collection jasmin-xfer available as per xfer servers, above hpxfer access role no longer required for these new servers (role will be retired along with the old servers in due course, so no need to renew if you move to the new servers) GridFTP server \u0026nbsp; Due to difficulties installing and configuring the suite of legacy components needed to support \u0026ldquo;old-style\u0026rdquo; gridftp, we will not now be providing a replacement for the old server gridftp1. Please familiarise yourself with using Globus, see below: this provides equivalent (and better) functionality.\nNote this does affect gridftp-over-ssh (sshftp) which is available on the new hpxfer nodes in the same way as their predecessors, see above.\nGlobus data transfer service \u0026nbsp; Where possible you should now use the Globus data transfer service for any data transfer in or out of JASMIN: this is now the recommended method, which will get you the best performance and has a number of advantages over logging into a server and doing transfers manually.\nAs introduced earlier this year, the following Globus collections are available to all users of JASMIN, with no special access roles required:\nname uuid status notes JASMIN Default Collection a2f53b7f-1b4e-4dce-9b7c-349ae760fee0 \u0026nbsp; Ready to use Best performance, currently has 2 physical Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs). JASMIN STFC Internal Collection 9efc947f-5212-4b5f-8c9d-47b93ae676b7 \u0026nbsp; Ready to use For transfers involving other collections inside the STFC network. 2 DTNs, 1 physical, 1 virtual. Can be used by any user in case of issues with the above collection. Notes:\nThese collections can be used with the Globus web interface\u0026nbsp; , command-line interface (CLI)\u0026nbsp; , or its Python software development kit (SDK)\u0026nbsp; , and use the JASMIN accounts portal for authentication Software \u0026nbsp; Please see the table below and accompanying notes which together summarise the upcoming changes to aspects of software on JASMIN:\nSoftware CentOS7 Rocky 9 IDL versions\nIDL licence server\nsee Note 1 8.2, 8.5 (D), 8.5, 8.6\nFlexnet 8.9, 9.1(D)\nNext generation Cylc\nCylc UI visualisation\nsee Note 2 7.8.14 and 8.3.3-1\nUI functionality integrated 8.3.3-1\nUI via browser: discussion ongoing Jaspy\nJasr\njasmin-sci 2.7, 3.7*, 3.10* (*: all variants)\n3.6, 4.0 (all variants), 4.2\nURL page of the packages 3.11\n4.3\nrpm/Glibc compatibility tba?

These will also be the versions available on the new cluster, which will be announced in early 2025. Licensing is now in place to enable use of these versions on Rocky 9 servers, in runtime or interactive mode. For the limited remaining time that the existing LOTUS cluster is available (with CentOS7 nodes), 8.5 is the default with other legacy versions still available on those nodes. Cylc: Note that Cylc 8 differs from Cylc 7 in many ways: architecture, scheduling algorithm, security, UIs, working practices and more. The Cylc 8 web UI requires the use of a browser (e.g. Firefox in the NoMachine desktop service)\nMPI: (further details to follow)\nJULES: (further details to follow)\nUpgraded LOTUS cluster \u0026nbsp; Preliminary node specification:\ntype status specs standard \u0026nbsp; Ready to use 190* CPU AMD EPYC 9654 / 1.5 TB RAM / 480 GB SATA SSD + 800 GB NvMe SSD high-mem \u0026nbsp; Ready to use 190* CPU AMD EPYC 9654 / 6 TB RAM / 480 GB SATA SSD + 800 GB NvMe SSD Notes:\n*2 CPU reserved for system processes Overall ~55,000 cores: ~triples capacity pf previous cluster New nodes will form a new cluster, managed separately to the \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; LOTUS Submission to the new cluster is now via sci-ph-0[1,2,3] and from one additional physical node (details TBC) with extended CentOS7 support, with restricted access to enable use of Cylc 7 for limited period. Submission to \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; LOTUS will only be from current CentOS7 sci machines sci[1-8] until 18 Feb 2025. and from one additional physical node (details TBC) with extended CentOS7 support, with restricted access to enable use of Cylc 7 for limited period. Nodes will gradually be removed from the \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; cluster and retired, timetable TBC once new cluster is up \u0026amp; running. New LOTUS2 cluster initial submission guide \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Please see the details below on how to access LOTUS2 and how to submit a job to the new Slurm scheduling partitions.\nThese require a Slurm account, partition and quality of service (QoS) to be specified at job submission time.\nLOTUS2 batch job submission hosts \u0026nbsp; Login to one of the following hosts:\nsci-ph-01.jasmin.ac.uk sci-ph-02.jasmin.ac.uk sci-ph-03.jasmin.ac.uk The hostname will be displayed as hostNNN. This host can be reached in the normal way via a login server.\n(Other submission hosts will be added in due course, see above)\nNew Slurm job accounting hierarchy \u0026nbsp; Slurm accounting by project has been introduced as a means of monitoring compute usage by projects on JASMIN. These projects align with group workspaces (GWSs), and you will automatically be added to Slurm accounts corresponding to any GWS projects that you belong to.\nTo find what Slurm accounts and quality of services that you have access to, use the useraccounts command on the job submission host (currently sci-ph-03.jasmin.ac.uk). Output should be similar to one or more of the lines below.\nuseraccounts fred mybiggws debug,highres,long,short,standard fred jules-test jules-test fred no-project debug,highres,long,short,standard fred orchid debug,highres,long,short,standard Users who do not belong to any group workspaces will be assigned the no-project account and should use that in their job submissions.\nPartitions and QoS \u0026nbsp; There are 3 partitions currently available on LOTUS2, with associated allowed quality of service (QoS) as shown below:\nPartition Allowed QoS standard standard, short, long highres highres, reservation debug debug, reservation QoS Priority Max CPUs per job Max wall time standard 500 1 24 hours short 550 1 4 hours long 350 1 5 days highres 450 2 days debug 500 1 hour Job submission \u0026nbsp; In order to successfully submit a job to LOTUS2, 3 mandatory fields must be specified. These are a partition, an account, and a QoS. The LOTUS2 configuration has been set to use the standard partition as the default if none is specified. However, users are discouraged from relying on the default.\nExample of a batch Script: NB: remove any trailing whitespace\nReplace mygws with the name of an account that you belong to (check with the useraccounts command, as shown above), and other values appropriate to your job.\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --job-name=\u0026#34;My test job\u0026#34; #SBATCH --time=00:01:00 #SBATCH --mem=1M #SBATCH --account=mygws #SBATCH --partition=debug #SBATCH --qos=debug # rest of script herewhere time\u0026nbsp; and mem\u0026nbsp; should be specified as per the sbatch documentation, which covers all available directives such as --cpus-per-task.\nSave this script file as e.g.test_submit.sh Then submit this with:\nsbatch test_submit.sh For a pseudo-interactive session on a LOTUS2 compute node:\n(again, replace mygws with an account that you belong to, from the useraccounts command)\nsrun --account=mygws --partition=debug --qos=debug --pty /bin/bash srun: job 586 queued and waiting for resources srun: job 586 has been allocated resources module li Currently Loaded Modules: 1) idl/9.1 Timetable for host retirements \u0026nbsp; Please find below a timetable of planned host retirements in line with our move to Rocky Linux 9.\nPlease start moving your work NOW so that any issues can be resolved and disruption minimized.\nHost retirement date Group A cron1.ceda aka cron.jasmin\nxfer3\nnx-login[2,3] 21/11/2024 16:00 Group B nx4 aka nx-login4 6/12/2024 16:00 Group C xfer1\nhpxfer1 - already shut down due to technical issue\nsci[1,2,4]\nlogin[1,2] 6/12/2024 16:00 Group D xfer2\nhpxfer2\nsci[5,6,8]\nlogin[3,4]\ngridftp1 13/12/2024 16:00 All the hosts listed have new Rocky 9 equivalents described in the document above.

        content: "Windows users are recommended to try the 3rd party application MobaXterm for connecting to JASMIN from Windows. Please note its licence conditions for ongoing use, however.\nVersions of MobaXterm \u0026nbsp; The instructions given below are for version 24 of MobaXterm. For other versions please check the MobaXterm documentation.\nThe method of configuring MobaXterm to store your private key has changed with different versions. The recommended method, and an alternative, are shown below.\nDownloading and installing MobaXterm \u0026nbsp; Visit the MobaXterm website\u0026nbsp; to download the free Home edition.\nThere are 2 editions available:\n\u0026ldquo;Portable\u0026rdquo; edition (can be installed as a regular user) \u0026ldquo;Installer\u0026rdquo; edition (may need admin privileges on your machine) Both editions should be functionally the same once installed, but your choice may depend on what level of access you have to your Windows machine.\nFor the \u0026ldquo;portable\u0026rdquo; edition, the contents of the downloaded zip file should be extracted to a folder (eg. on your Windows desktop) where you can double-click the executable file MobaXterm_Personal_xx.x (where xx.x is the version number). Note that the CygUtils.plugin file should remain in this folder as this is used for storing settings.\nOnce opened, MobaXterm presents a screen like this:\nMobaXterm's initial screen You can use the Start local terminal button or click the + tab to open multiple tabs with a different terminal session in each tab. However, it\u0026rsquo;s worth setting up MobaXterm so that your private key is held globally and is available to any new terminal session that you open.\nEnabling MobAgent to store your private key \u0026nbsp; In order to log in to a remote host (e.g. a JASMIN host) you need to present your private key which is kept your local machine. MobaXterm provides MobAgent which can store your key for the time you are running MobaXterm, and can then present it for you, for any session in any tab, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to enter your passphrase for each new tab that you open.\nVideo demonstration \u0026nbsp; The video below demonstrates this process, or you can follow the screenshots which follow:\nSteps with screenshots \u0026nbsp; You need to enable MobAgent in Settings \u0026gt; Configuration \u0026gt; SSH:\nSSH Configuration tab To do this:\nTick Use internal SSH agent \u0026quot;MobAgent\u0026quot; Un-tick Use external Pageant Click the + symbol to locate your private key file (e.g. id_ecdsa_jasmin) Click OK to save the settings. MobaXterm will now need to restart. When you restart MobaXterm you will be prompted for the passphrase associated with your private key. Private key passphrase prompt Once MobaXterm has started, you can check that your SSH key has been loaded by clicking on Start local terminal and using ssh-add -l to list the keys currently loaded.\nWhen you type the following command in the MobaXterm terminal, you should see output similar to below:\n\u0026nbsp; IMPORTANT: The box below is an example of what your command line prompt might look like.\nThe username and computer name on the left indicates which machine you are currently on. Everything to the right of the dollar symbol \u0026lsquo;$\u0026rsquo; is the command which you are entering into the terminal.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to type the \u0026lsquo;$\u0026rsquo; or anything before it!\nThe rest of the documentation will use this format to show whether you should run the command on your local machine (user@localhost) or on JASMIN (user@sci-vm-01).\nssh-add -l 521 SHA256:ZeddNKK5U3am1vyCaUCq4CgMRpvoyv+cJiviqz3zvfw ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin (ECDSA) Sometimes the last part of this output shows your email address, but it is just a comment field at the end of the key, which can be ignored. The fact that it\u0026rsquo;s returned something which looks like a key \u0026ldquo;fingerprint\u0026rdquo;, shows that your key is loaded successfully into the agent.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t see your key listed in output similar to the above, please try again: perhaps you entered the wrong passphrase? But you will need to succeed in loading your key before you can connect to JASMIN.\nLogging in to JASMIN using key stored in MobAgent \u0026nbsp; As shown in the video above, once you have set up MobAgent you can connect to JASMIN by creating a new terminal window. Click the Start local terminal button.\nNext, try connecting to the login server:\nssh -A \u0026lt;user_id\u0026gt;@login-01.jasmin.ac.uk Notes:\nreplace \u0026lt;user_id\u0026gt; with your own JASMIN username) check the list of available login servers: you don\u0026rsquo;t have to use the one above! Logging in to JASMIN without storing your key in MobAgent \u0026nbsp; MobAgent provides the most convenient way of accessing JASMIN. However, if you want to login to JASMIN without setting up MobAgent you can do so as follows.\nClick on the Start local terminal button then enter the following command. The final two lines show the output you should see: you are prompted for your key\u0026rsquo;s passphrase, then if successful, you see confirmation that the key is loaded.\neval $(ssh-agent -s) ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin Enter passphrase for ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin: Identity added: ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin If your key is named something different, or stored at a different location than shown above, you will need to specify its location in the ssh-add command. Note that MobaXterm refers to Windows drives as e.g. /drives/c/ (with forward slashes). So if you\u0026rsquo;ve put your key on your desktop, then the path to that might be /drives/c/Users/fred/Desktop/id_ecdsa_jasmin (if \u0026ldquo;fred\u0026rdquo; is your local username on Windows).\nYou will need to do this each time you open a new terminal session. To connect to JASMIN:\nssh -A \u0026lt;user_id\u0026gt;@login-01.jasmin.ac.uk Again, you must replace \u0026lt;user_id\u0026gt; with your JASMIN username.\nAs you can see, the MobAgent method mentioned previously makes this a bit easier, because it persists between sessions and you navigate to the location of your private key using graphical tools instead of having to type the path.\nAdditional MobaXterm features \u0026nbsp; MobaXterm is a comprehensive application that enables many useful features such as:\nSaved session configurations X-forwarding / X11 / X server (Not recommended on JASMIN, see NoMachine NX for graphical linux desktop instead) SSH agent forwarding SFTP access (with graphical drag-n-drop) Split-tab mode SSH tunnelling Basic Linux commands such as: cd, ls, pwd, cat Command-line transfer utilities: scp, rsync, wget Please see the MobaXterm documentation\u0026nbsp; for details on these."

        content: "This article defines the types of account available on JASMIN and their purpose. It covers:\nSTANDARD accounts (with note about training accounts) SHARED accounts SERVICE accounts Introduction \u0026nbsp; For some time, we have been asked by user communities to cater for legitimate use cases where accounts need to be shared by a small, known and pre-arranged set of users, or by services or functions.\nTo maintain a secure approach, we have brought these together into a clearly- defined set of account types for each purpose.\nDefinitions \u0026nbsp; STANDARD accounts \u0026nbsp; A standard account:\nis for use by one human individual user only. can login to the JASMIN accounts portal to (re)set a password, store an SSH key and apply for access roles. has a unique SSH key, traceable to its owner. Training accounts are a special type of STANDARD account, issued on a short-term basis and preconfigured with certain access roles as required for training events.\nA standard account holder may act as a responsible user on one more service or shared accounts.\nSHARED accounts \u0026nbsp; A shared account:\nis for use by a small, defined set of responsible users , each associated by their standard account username has a set of SSH public keys, one for each responsible user. The shared account itself does not have a key, and users do not share keys. The set of keys associated with the shared account is updated automatically in the event that any individual responsible user changes their the SSH key on their own standard account. can log in to the JASMIN accounts portal using the shared account username to apply for roles and can (re)set a a password, which may be shared securely** and only between the set of responsible users. The accounts portal profile for the shared account will display, but not allow editing of, the public keys of the responsible users. can be used by individual responsible users to login via SSH, but using their own individual SSH private key which must not be shared with any other user, and should be kept locally, i.e. not uploaded to anywhere on JASMIN. by default, emails originating from the JASMIN accounts portal destined for shared accounts are instead sent to all their responsible users. An optional email address for the shared account itself may be specified in the accounts portal profile for the account. can perform any action in the system that a standard account can, including but not limited to the following (and subject to membership of relevant access roles): becoming a member of a group workspace using elastic tape / JDMA submitting a job to the LOTUS batch processing cluster obtaining an short-lived credential for use with a high-performance transfer method may be requested by a user or group of users via the JASMIN helpdesk, but the decision as to whether to grant the request is at the discretion of the JASMIN team, after scrutiny of the request, its justification and the past JASMIN behaviour of the individual users proposed to be responsible for the shared account. **An example of a secure means of sharing a password is to use Keeper (or similar password manager system) to share a securely-stored entry with a specific list of other individuals in an encrypted form. Password sharing via unencrypted means (such as a text file, email or post-it note) is not permitted.\nSERVICE accounts \u0026nbsp; A service account:\nis for use by a service or function only has one or more responsible users , each associated by their standard account username can never log in to the JASMIN accounts portal or (re)set a password. may be granted roles by arrangement with the JASMIN team has no SSH key emails originating from the JASMIN accounts portal destined for service accounts are instead sent to all their responsible users. An optional email address for the service account itself may be specified in the accounts portal profile for the account. may be requested by a user or group of users via the JASMIN helpdesk, but the decision as to whether to grant the request is at the discretion of the JASMIN team, after scrutiny of the request, its justification and the past JASMIN behaviour of the individual users proposed to be responsible for the service account. NOTES:\nWith the implementation of these new account types, existing setups will be examined and discussed with their \u0026ldquo;owners\u0026rdquo; and moved over to either service or shared account types as appropriate. Users of a shared or service account are jointly responsible for actions performed by the account. This requires coordination and communication between responsible users, which should be done independently of the JASMIN system. Membership of a shared or service account , and availability of the account itself, may be withdrawn if behaviour falls outside the JASMIN Terms and Conditions\u0026nbsp; . In serious cases, individual users may be barred from further use of JASMIN altogether. Users are reminded to familiarise themselves with the Terms and Conditions and have a responsibility to keep up to date with them as they change. Users must also pay attention to service announcements made by the JASMIN team by email and other means. Requests for shared or service accounts should be sent to the JASMIN helpdesk with \u0026ldquo;shared account request\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;service account request\u0026rdquo; in the subject line."

        description: "New storage FAQs and issues",
        
        
        content: "\u0026nbsp; This article was originally written in 2018/19 to introduce new forms of storage which were brought into production at that stage. Some of the information and terminology is now out of date, pending further review of JASMIN documentation. Workflows with some of the issues highlighted below will have a knock on effect for other users, so please take the time to check and change your code to make appropriate use of new storage system. If used correctly, the new storage offers us a high performance scalable file system, with the capability for object storage as tools and interfaces evolve, and we can continue to serve the growing demand for storage in the most cost effective manner.\nWe understand these changes may cause you some extra work, but we hope that you can understand why they were necessary and how to adapt to these changes. We will continue to add to this page when new issues or solutions are found.\n1. Known cases where parallel write can occur (may be unknowingly to you!): \u0026nbsp; Use of MPI-IO or OpenMPI \u0026nbsp; Parallel threads can update the same file concurrently on same or from different servers.\nSuggested solution: use a /work/scratch-pw* volume which is PFS (but not /work/scratch-nopw* !), then move output to SOF storage.\nWriting all the logs from a LOTUS job or job array to the same output or log file \u0026nbsp; Suggested solution: see job submission advice here showing how to use SBATCH options to use distinct output and log files for each job, or element of a job array.\nDeleting a file via one host before another host has closed it \u0026nbsp; This is a form of parallel write truncation\nSuggested solution: take care to check for completion of 1 process before another process deletes or modifies a file. Be sure to check a job has completed before interactively deleting files from any server you are logged into (eg. sci1.jasmin.ac.uk)\nAttempting to kill a process that was writing/modifying files, but not checking that it has been killed before starting a replacement process which attempts to do the same thing \u0026nbsp; This can happen with rsync leading to duplicate copying processes.\nSuggested solution: check for successful termination of 1 process before starting another.\nOpening the same file for editing in more than one editor on the same or different servers \u0026nbsp; Here’s an example of how this shows up using “lsof” and by listing user processes with “ps”. The same file “ISIMIPnc_to_SDGVMtxt.py” is being edited in 2 separate “vim” editors. In this case, the system team was unable to kill the processes on behalf of the user, so the only solution was to reboot sci1.\nlsof /gws/nopw/j04/gwsnnn/ COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME vim 20943 fbloggs cwd DIR 0,43 0 2450 /gws/nopw/j04/gwsnnn/fbloggs/sdgvm/ISIMIP vim 20943 fbloggs 4u REG 0,43 24576 2896 /gws/nopw/j04/gwsnnn/fbloggs/sdgvm/ISIMIP/.ISIMIPnc_to_SDGVMtxt.py.swp vim 31843 fbloggs cwd DIR 0,43 0 2450 /gws/nopw/j04/gwsnnn/fbloggs/sdgvm/ISIMIP vim 31843 fbloggs 3r REG 0,43 12111 2890 /gws/nopw/j04/gwsnnn/fbloggs/sdgvm/ISIMIP/ISIMIPnc_to_SDGVMtxt.py ps -ef | grep fbloggs ...... fbloggs 20943 1 0 Jan20 ? 00:00:00 vim ISIMIPnc_to_SDGVMtxt.py fbloggs 31843 1 0 Jan20 ? 00:00:00 vim ISIMIPnc_to_SDGVMtxt.py smc_1D-2D_1979-2012_Asia_NewDelhi.py Suggested solution: If you are unable to kill the processes yourself, contact the helpdesk with sufficient information to ask for it to be done for you. In some cases, the only solution at present is for the host or hosts to be rebooted.\n2. Issues with small files \u0026nbsp; The larger file systems in operation within JASMIN are suitable for storing and manipulating large datasets and not currently optimised for handling small ( \u0026lt;64kBytes) files. These systems are not the same as those you would find on a desktop computer or even large server, and often involve many disks to store the data itself and metadata servers to store the file system metadata (such as file size, modification dates, ownership etc). If you are compiling code from source files, or running code from python virtual environments, these are examples of activities which can involve accessing large numbers of small files.\nLater versions of our PFS systems handled this by using SSD storage for small files, transparent to the user. SOF however, can’t do this (until later in 2019), so in Phase 4, we introduced larger home directories based on SSD, as well as an additional and larger scratch area.\nSuggested solution: Please consider using your home directory for small- file storage, or /work/scratch-nopw2 for situations involving LOTUS intermediate job storage. It should be possible to share code, scripts and other small files from your home directory by changing the file and directory permissions yourself.\nWe are planning to address this further in Phase 5 by deploying additional SSD storage which could be made available in small amounts to GWSs as an additional type of storage. [Now available: please ask about adding an \u0026ldquo;SMF\u0026rdquo; volume to your workspace]\nIssues writing netCDF3 classic files to SOF storage type \u0026nbsp; Writing netCDF3 classic files to SOF storage e.g. /gws/nopw/j04/* should be avoided. This is due to the fact that operations involving a lot of repositioning of the file pointer (as happens with netCDF3 writing) has similar issues from writing large numbers of small files to SOF storage (known as QB ).\nSuggested solution: It is more efficient to write netCDF3 classic files to another filesystem type (e.g. /work/scratch/pw* or /work/scratch-nopw2) and then move them to a SOF GWS, rather than writing directly to SOF.\n3. \u0026ldquo;Everything\u0026rsquo;s running slowly today\u0026rdquo; \u0026nbsp; This can be due to overloading of the scientific analysis servers (sci*.jasmin.ac.uk) which we provide for interactive use. They’re great for testing a code and developing a workflow, but are not designed for actually doing the big processing. Please take this heavy-lifting or long-running work to the LOTUS batch processing cluster, leaving the interactive compute nodes responsive enough for everyone to use.\nSuggested solution: When you log in via one of the login*.jasmin.ac.uk nodes, you are shown a \u0026lsquo;message of the day\u0026rsquo;: a list of all the sci* machines, along with memory usage and the number of users on each node at that time. This can help you select a less-used machine (but don’t necessarily expect the same machine to be the right choice next time!)."

        content: "Introduction \u0026nbsp; This article explains that users may request access to a PostgreSQL (known as Postgres) database on JASMIN for use with scientific workflows.\nOverview of the user database service \u0026nbsp; There are a large number of different workflows on JASMIN and it is common for users to require access to persistent storage of information about the progress of a workflow. In some cases, it is appropriate for users to save information in a relational database. Examples might be to create/update/delete data records (when working with small results) or to store the success/failure of batch tasks (running on LOTUS).\nTo meet this need, a user database service is available on request. The service provides secured access to a Postgres\u0026nbsp; database that is accessible from the interactive and batch compute nodes on JASMIN. An individual user, or group of users, can be issued with login credentials to enable read and/or write access to the database.\nHow to request a Postgres database for use on JASMIN \u0026nbsp; In order to request a Postgres database from the user database service, please ensure you have a JASMIN Login account and then send a message to the JASMIN Helpdesk. You should include the following information in your message:\nstate that you would like a user database set up your JASMIN user ID Postgres details: database name, database user account name the expected size of the database (fully populated) machines (inside JASMIN) from which you would like to contact the database If you require backups of the database to be made. Postgres extensions \u0026nbsp; The Postgres installation includes the following extension:\nPostGIS\u0026nbsp; Backups \u0026nbsp; By default we make daily backups of the databases, which are kept for a week. We keep a weekly backup for a month and a monthly backup for 6 months. These intervals may be subject to change, so if you have particular concerns about backups please let us know. If your database is particularly large we may either make less frequent backups or not make backups at all. We will discuss any particular backup requirements you may have when we set up your database.\nYou should contact the JASMIN Helpdesk to request access to previous backups.\nRestrictions and limitations \u0026nbsp; Please note that the following restrictions and limitations apply to the user database service:\nWe cannot provide training in SQL or the use of relational databases: please ensure that you have the appropriate experience before requesting access. There is a size limit on the server and the disk that the user databases are housed on: if you expect to store many GBs of data then please discuss this with the JASMIN Team. The database cannot be made accessible outside the JASMIN firewall: it is intended to support applications and workflows that take place inside JASMIN. The database should not be considered as a long-term data store: you should migrate any content elsewhere if you intend to keep it for the medium or long term."

        content: "There are 2 main ways to present your SSH key when connecting via SSH-based methods:\nFile method: specifying the path to the private key file and entering the passphrase each time Agent method: loading the key into a persistent ssh-agent, which stores the key ready for any subsequent connections you want to make (sometimes, this works for other applications too). Method pros/cons 1. Specify the location of your SSH private key \u0026nbsp; simple \u0026nbsp; no admin permissions needed\n\u0026nbsp; works for all platforms if you update your key to ECDSA 2. Use your key stored in a local ssh-agent \u0026nbsp; useful if you use many applications which use SSH (e.g. NX, VSCode)\n\u0026nbsp; may need admin permissions for 1st-time agent setup\n\u0026nbsp; careful editing of config file required in some cases 1. Specifying the key location each time \u0026nbsp; This simply involves including the -i option in the SSH command to specify the location of your private key:\n(You would type this command in a terminal window on your local computer i.e. desktop/laptop). This might be:\nWindows Windows command or PowerShell terminal window (no additional software needed) MobaXterm (a 3rd party linux terminal emulator for windows, licence required) PuTTy (a 3rd party suite of SSH tools including some GUI utilities) Mac: \u0026ldquo;Terminal\u0026rdquo; or similar applications Linux: \u0026ldquo;Terminal\u0026rdquo; or similar applications Note: the \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; location to store your key is the .ssh directory within your home directory. Storing it elsewhere, particularly on Windows, can cause permissions problems.\nssh -i path_to/my_private_key user@remotehost 2. Loading your key into an agent \u0026nbsp; We\u0026rsquo;ll demonstrate the following methods:\nWindows (option 1): Windows OpenSSH Client in cmd window Windows (option 2): MobaXterm Mac: \u0026ldquo;Terminal\u0026rdquo; application Linux: \u0026ldquo;Terminal\u0026rdquo; or similar application Methods to load your key \u0026nbsp; Windows (1: cmd, gui) Windows (2: Pageant) Windows (2: MobaXterm) Windows (3: Powershell) Mac Linux Follow the video above for how to set up the ssh-agent and load your key:\nOnce you have loaded your key this way, and if you have set the Windows OpenSSH Authentication Agent service to start automatically, then next time you restart windows, your key will load automatically when you log in to Windows. You should consider whether that is the desired behaviour, considering any shared use of that machine, and you should protect your Windows login with strong security.\nFollow the video above for how to set up the ssh-agent and load your key. This method should not need any additional admin permissions once you have got the PuTTY suite of tools installed (PuTTY, PuTTYgen, Pageant, available from here\u0026nbsp; )\nNotes:\nRemember that you need a licence to use MobaXterm beyond the intial free trial period.\nThe method shown above does not work with applications outside of MobaXterm (like NoMachine NX or VSCode): you would need to use the Windows OpenSSH client instead to use these with an agent, or set MobaXterm to use the external Pageant agent.\nThe video above shows the following steps to enable MobAgent and load your key:\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Configuration \u0026gt; SSH Tick Use internal SSH agent \u0026quot;MobAgent\u0026quot; Un-tick Use external Pageant Click the + symbol to locate your private key file (e.g. id_ecdsa_jasmin) Click OK to save the settings. MobaXterm will now need to restart. When you restart MobaXterm, you will be prompted for the passphrase associated with your private key. The equivalent action in a Mobaxterm terminal window is\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin but note the following:\nThis loads the key from ~/.ssh, which is within your MobaXterm home directory. This may not be the same location as your Windows home directory $USERPROFILE/.ssh. Which one you use depends on where you saved your key when you generated it. Beware, though: the Windows representation of the path (e.g. C:\\Users\\Fred\\.ssh\\) needs to be converted to the cygwin representation using cygpath, for use within the MobaXterm terminal (cygpath is part of Cygwin\u0026nbsp; , the underlying Linux emulation library used by MobaXterm). Or just cd to that directory first! cygpath $USERPROFILE/.ssh/ /drives/c/Users/Fred/.ssh/ This method only persists for this particular MobaXterm session. If you want it to always load your key when MobaXterm starts, use the method described in the video above. The equivalent steps in Powershell are as follows:\nCheck that the OpenSSH client installed with, either by\nlocating \u0026ldquo;optional features\u0026rdquo; and finding \u0026ldquo;OpenSSH Client\u0026rdquo; if it\u0026rsquo;s not installed, tick the box to select it, then click \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo;, then \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; (and wait: NB this can be slow!) or\ntyping this command in a PowerShell window, as administrator Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like \u0026#39;OpenSSH.Client*\u0026#39; if it IS installed, you\u0026rsquo;ll see something like this:\nName : OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0 State : Installed if it\u0026rsquo;s NOT installed, you\u0026rsquo;ll see\nName : OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0 State : NotPresent in which case, note the name and version, and use them in this command:\nAdd-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0 Eventually (this can be slow!) you should see:\nPath : Online : True RestartNeeded : False Now you can set up the OpenSSH client:\nSet the ssh-agent service so that it starts manually, and start it on this occasion: Get-Service ssh-agent Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Manual Start-Service ssh-agent (once you\u0026rsquo;re confident that it\u0026rsquo;s working correctly, you could set -StartupType Automatic)\nLoad your key into the ssh-agent Load the key from where it\u0026rsquo;s saved: this should be your .ssh directory in your home directory. Storing it elsewhere can cause permissions problems.\nNote that the windows environment variable %USERPROFILE% is $env:USERPROFILE in PowerShell. In this example, we\u0026rsquo;re in that directory already, so we can just use the relative path .ssh\\ to the key. But the full path would be $env:USERPROFILE\\.ssh\\id_ecdsa_jasmin\nssh-add .ssh\\id_ecdsa_jasmin Enter passphrase for \u0026lt;path to key\u0026gt;: ## right-click to paste your passphrase, then press return Identity added: (\u0026lt;path to key\u0026gt;) Once you have loaded your key this way, and if you have set the Windows OpenSSH Authentication Agent service to start automatically, then next time you restart windows, your key will load automatically when you log in to Windows. You should consider whether that is the desired behaviour, considering any shared use of that machine, and you should protect your Windows login with strong security.\nMac \u0026nbsp; Mac users (OS X Leopard onwards) can optionally benefit from linking the SSH key to Keychain, which securely stores the passphrase as well. This means that even after a reboot, your SSH key is always available in any terminal session automatically. You can do this by running ssh-add with --apple-use-keychain:\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin --apple-use-keychain And then by adding the corresponding command with --apple-load-keychain to your .zshrc file so that it loads it for every new terminal session:\necho \u0026#34;ssh-add --apple-load-keychain\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.zshrc Linux \u0026nbsp; Some linux terminal and desktop environments provide an ssh-agent as a graphical application: consult the documentation for your system.\nA common one is gnome-keyring-daemon: check for this first in your list of processes: if it\u0026rsquo;s there and running already, skip to the ssh-add command, rather than starting up another ssh-agent (which might then be ignored by the application you\u0026rsquo;re trying to use).\nIn the absence of an already-running process, you can use the following commands in a terminal session:\nStart the ssh-agent eval $(ssh-agent -s) Agent pid 94631 If the agent starts successfully, a process id (pid) is returned as above.\nLoad the key ssh-add \u0026lt;path to key\u0026gt; Enter passphrase for \u0026lt;path to key\u0026gt;: ## right-click to paste your passphrase, then press return Identity added (\u0026lt;path to key\u0026gt;) Check that your key is loaded \u0026nbsp; In all cases, you should now check that the key is loaded and ready to use\nssh-add -l 521 SHA256:ZeddNKK5U3am1vyCaUCq4CgMRpvoyv+cJiviqz3zvfw ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin (ECDSA) If you see output similar to the above, your key is now ready to be used in an SSH connection.\nSometimes the last part of this output shows your email address, but it is just a comment field, which can be ignored. The fact that it\u0026rsquo;s returned something which looks like a key \u0026ldquo;fingerprint\u0026rdquo;, shows that your key is loaded successfully into the agent.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t see your key listed in output similar to the above, please try again: perhaps you entered the wrong passphrase? But you will need to succeed in loading your key before you can use it to make an SSH connection.\nOnce the key is loaded, it can be used in an SSH connection, but whether this persists between different sessions may be dependent on your system configuration.\nTroubleshooting \u0026nbsp; Unprotected private key file \u0026nbsp; Sometimes the SSH agent or application will refuse to load the private key from the file if the file\u0026rsquo;s permissions are set too loosely: some SSH clients insist that you and only you (no other users or services on the same machine) can access the file.\nTo overcome this you have 3 options:\n(Solves most Windows cases) Move the key files (id_edcsa_jasmin and id_edcsa_jasmin.pub: keep them together) to the .ssh directory which is inside your home directory. This is the \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; location, helps to manage all your keys in one place. Windows also applies different permissions rules to files in this location, so this usually solves the problem\n(Next simplest) Another option is to send just the contents of the file to the ssh-add command:\nIn your terminal where you give the ssh-add command, try this instead:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin | ssh-add - (replace id_ecdsa_jasmin with the path to and/or name of your private key file)\nThe cat command simply \u0026ldquo;streams\u0026rdquo; the contents of the file to standard output (stdout), while the trailing hyphen tells the ssh-add command to accept this streamed input (stdin) instead of from a file.\n(Windows: while the cat command is available in PowerShell and MobaXterm terminal environments, it is not in the Windows cmd environment).\nYou should be asked for your passphrase in the normal way and can check that the key has loaded correctly with:\nssh-add -l or (perhaps for a more permanent solution), and/or if you are getting similar errors mentioning the ~/.ssh/config file, might need to change the permissions permanently on these file(s).\nchange the permisisons on the file\nLinux/Mac/cygwin/Mobaxterm Windows: PowerShell chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin (replace id_ecdsa_jasmin with the path to and/or name of your private key file)\nThe equivalent method in Windows PowerShell involves these steps, replacing the expression with id_ecdsa_jasmin with the path to your key if different. You may need to open the PowerShell window with \u0026ldquo;run as administrator\u0026rdquo;.\n# Set a variable \u0026#34;Key\u0026#34; to hold the key filename: New-Variable -Name Key -Value \u0026#34;$env:UserProfile\\.ssh\\id_ecdsa_jasmin\u0026#34; # Remove Inheritance: Icacls $Key /c /t /Inheritance:d # Set Ownership to Owner: # For a key file located beneath directory $env:UserProfile: Icacls $Key /c /t /Grant $env:UserName:F # For a key file located outside of directory $env:UserProfile: TakeOwn /F $Key Icacls $Key /c /t /Grant:r $env:UserName:F # Remove All Users, except for Owner: Icacls $Key /c /t /Remove:g Administrator \u0026#34;Authenticated Users\u0026#34; BUILTIN\\Administrators BUILTIN Everyone System Users # Verify: Icacls $Key # Remove Variable: Remove-Variable -Name Key"

        content: "This article is for consortium managers and explains:\nThe overall process and role of consortium manager How to process a request for new resources for a service, submitted by a project How to process a request for additional resources on an existing project\u0026rsquo;s service Introduction \u0026nbsp; Please make sure you have read the article \u0026ldquo;Requesting resources\u0026rdquo; to understand how the process works from the requester\u0026rsquo;s point of view.\nThis article will show you how to process requests for resources, but also show you what you need to consider when doing so.\nOverall process \u0026nbsp; The overall process for handling requests for resources from projects is summarised as follows. It all happens via the JASMIN Projects Portal\u0026nbsp; .\nA project owner will have created a record representing a project for you to review This will come to you for review because they have selected your consortium as the most relevant to their work. But this means that the resources they are requesting need to come out of your consortium allocation. The project record should contain: A project description Requests for 1 or more services. Each proposed service (e.g., a Group Workspace or a Cloud Tenancy) can have 1 or more requirements for resources For a Group Workspace service, these could be requirements for disk or tape storage For a Cloud Tenancy service, these could be requirements for disk, CPU and memory resources for the tenancy Once all the requirements for a service have been agreed with the project owner, you, as consortium manager can submit the request for provisioning by the JASMIN team. Different services on the same project can be provisioned separately: for example, we can provision the Group Workspace resources while you\u0026rsquo;re still discussing what\u0026rsquo;s needed for a cloud tenancy. But all the requirements for a particular service (for example, disk and tape, for a Group Workspace) need to be agreed before it can be submitted for provisioning. If necessary, certain requirements can simply be rejected and excluded from the submission and can be added later. Requests made by projects directly to the JASMIN team will be referred back to this process, as it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we manage valuable resources in an organised manner, involving you as consortium manager to make decisions for your consortium\u0026rsquo;s allocations. So this does involve active engagement on your part. Once resources have been provisioned, you should be notified so that you can track the progress of the request on behalf of the project. Role of the consortium manager \u0026nbsp; Your task when reviewing should be to:\nCheck that the project has selected the appropriate consortium: does this activity sit within your domain? Scrutinise the project\u0026rsquo;s request for use of your allocation of consortium resources for this project. Questions to consider are: Do the proposed resource requirements sound reasonable? Have they properly considered using shared services like scratch and XFC to minimise the need for their own dedicated resources? For example: Instead of 100TB SOF for their Group Workspace, could they manage with 25TB, knowing that copious scratch space is nearly always available? Could some of the 100TB go on tape first, \u0026ldquo;streaming\u0026rdquo; their processing so that only some fraction is needed on disk at a time? Have they asked for tape resources alongside their disk space? (this would reassure you that they\u0026rsquo;ve considered a sensible workflow like above, but you might want to discuss with them). It\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to ask for an equivalent amount of space on tape as on disk. Historically this has usually been provisioned by default anyway, but we do want to capture what the project actually plans to use. Is the proposed workflow free of unnecessary duplication of data already available elsewhere on JASMIN, either in the CEDA Archive or other Group Workspaces (which can be processed in place rather than needing to be copied)? Some of this information will be in the project description but feel free to contact the project owner to gather more details yourself to form your opinion. Are the start and end dates realistic? You will need to reclaim your consortium\u0026rsquo;s resources once a project has finished (in order to support other projects from your allocation), so it\u0026rsquo;s important that these dates are agreed and regularly reviewed. Does the project actually need all the requested resources initially, or could they manage with some fraction to start with? \u0026ldquo;Hogging\u0026rdquo; disk space (or other resources), but not using it, wastes expensive resources. Is there a date beyond which the data could be moved off disk onto tape, freeing up disk? The project\u0026rsquo;s requirements can be modified during its lifetime to achieve this, but this should be considered (at the start) as a way to \u0026ldquo;sunset\u0026rdquo; the disk requirements while keeping some data still available after the active phase of the project. Group Workspace storage is short-term storage for the duration of a project only. Keeping data in Group Workspace disk storage in an open-ended way is bad for a number of reasons: other projects won\u0026rsquo;t have the resources they need, plus there are a number of data-sharing services attached to the CEDA Archive (such as, enabling other projects to discover the data) which make this a much better place to share data from, with all the benefits of professional data curation. The disk requirement for Group Workspaces should only be allocated for the active phase of the project where working space is needed. Longer-term visibility of any data produced should be addressed by involving the CEDA Archive team at the project planning stage. Processing a request for new resources \u0026nbsp; Log in to the JASMIN Projects Portal\u0026nbsp; This requires your JASMIN credentials (so you need to have a JASMIN account to proceed). Two-factor authentication is used: you can opt to send a verification code to the email address registered with your JASMIN account, then enter that code to proceed. Check your spam folder if the message doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear.\nFollow the \u0026ldquo;Consortia\u0026rdquo; link at the top, to show all the consortia. The one(s) you are responsible for will have a \u0026ldquo;Go to consortium\u0026rdquo; button.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Go to consortium\u0026rdquo;\nThis screen has 3 tabs: we are looking at the \u0026ldquo;overview\u0026rdquo; tab first, showing your how much of each type of resource is committed (provisioned) against the allocated resources for your consortium.\nGo to the \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; tab. If you have any projects with outstanding items for review, the number of projects will be indicated next to the \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; tab.\nHere we can see all the projects in this consortium: scroll down to see \u0026ldquo;cards\u0026rdquo; for all the projects. The tab indicated that there were 2 to be reviewed and these are labelled here too.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Go to Project\u0026rdquo; for the one you want to review, to see the project overview screen.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Overview\u0026rdquo; screen for a project gives you the timeline of what\u0026rsquo;s happened (most recent first) so you can see the description and any comments.\nNow go to the \u0026ldquo;Services\u0026rdquo; tab, to see what service(s) this project thinks it needs, and what resources are requested for those services:\nIn this case, they\u0026rsquo;re just asking for a Group Workspace, and have documented a requirement for 10 TB of SOF disk space, between the dates shown. For now, we\u0026rsquo;ll just consider how to approve that one request (but you could encourage them to ask for tape space as well, then approve both together).\nThe SOF requirement is in the \u0026ldquo;REQUESTED\u0026rdquo; state, meaning it\u0026rsquo;s awaiting your review, so click the \u0026ldquo;?\u0026rdquo; icon, to review that requirement:\nHere, you can see that this requirement for 10 TB SOF of SOF disk is OK in terms of your consortium\u0026rsquo;s overall allocation for SOF (1.6 PB), and current commitments (770.2 TB or 48%) against that allocation. But only you know what other projects are in the pipeline in your science domain:\nis there some big project on the horizon which will need lots of space in the near future? if you\u0026rsquo;re struggling for space, are there other projects which you could ask to give up some or all of their disk space, if they\u0026rsquo;ve finished their work? if they\u0026rsquo;ve asked for particular types of disk space (PFS, SSD or HPOS), have they justified why? The default storage type for Group Workspaces should be SOF, but there may be reasons why others are more appropriate, e.g. HPOS (Object Storage) for visibility inside / outside of JASMIN (to be encouraged!) SSD (Solid State Disk) for small file storage (but very limited amounts available, normally 100GB at a time) PFS (Parallel File System) for workflows which absolutely must be able to write in parallel to the same file from multiple processes (\u0026hellip;but there are 2 PB of scratch space available for this purpose, so consider carefully). If you want to suggest changes to the project (e.g. you think they\u0026rsquo;ve picked the wrong type) you can \u0026ldquo;Reject\u0026rdquo; with comments, and they can re-submit the request.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re happy to approve, click \u0026ldquo;Approve\u0026rdquo;:\nThe SOF requirement now has status \u0026ldquo;APPROVED\u0026rdquo; so (as long as there are no other requirements in \u0026ldquo;REQUESTED\u0026rdquo; state), you can click \u0026ldquo;Submit for provisioning\u0026rdquo;.\nIf there are other requirements that have been requested, you either need to approve them too, or reject them so that you can agree acceptable resource request with the project owner.\nIf submitted, the requirement will then have the status \u0026ldquo;AWAITING PROVISIONING\u0026rdquo; and the JASMIN team will pick up the request to arrange provision of the resources.\nOnce the JASMIN team has completed provisioning the resources, the status changes to \u0026ldquo;PROVISIONED\u0026rdquo; and the location is confirmed: in this case giving the path to the disk space now that\u0026rsquo;s now available.\nAt this point, the project owner who requested the resources would also be notified to check the status on the portal, so should be able to pick up the location, but you may wish to check with them yourself, to track the request to completion.\nProcessing a request for additional resources \u0026nbsp; Where a project already exists, a project owner can submit a request for changes to resources on an existing service, or could request an additional service (e.g. adding a cloud tenancy where there\u0026rsquo;s already a Group Workspace). Adding an additional service should work as described above, but reviewing a request to modify resources on an existing service, is shown below:\nWe start from the project overview screen (so check above for steps to reach that):\nWe can see in the comments that something has been requested: those comments are attached by the project owner to provide extra context to the request.\nGo to the Service tab to review further:\nHere we can see the original 10 TB which is \u0026ldquo;PROVISIONED\u0026rdquo; but above it is the request for the additional 1 TB, with status \u0026ldquo;REQUESTED\u0026rdquo;.\nClick the \u0026ldquo;?\u0026rdquo; to review:\nFrom the consortium manager\u0026rsquo;s point of view, it\u0026rsquo;s the same process as before, so go through the same steps to scrutinise the request.\nReject the request (with comments) if you want the project owner to change things, or approve it if you\u0026rsquo;re happy:\nNow the request is marked as \u0026ldquo;APPROVED\u0026rdquo;, and since we have no other requests in \u0026ldquo;REQUESTED\u0026rdquo; state for you to review, you can click \u0026ldquo;Submit for provisioning\u0026rdquo;.\nOnce you have submitted it, the request is marked \u0026ldquo;AWAITING PROVISIONING\u0026rdquo; for the JASMIN team to pick up.\nIn this case, we\u0026rsquo;re adding space to the same service, so when it comes to recording what\u0026rsquo;s provisioned, the 10 TB \u0026amp; 1 TB \u0026ldquo;chunks\u0026rdquo; will be combined (in terms of how they\u0026rsquo;re recorded here), reflecting the fact that the JASMIN team will have simply expanded the size of the (single) disk volume. This makes sense if the project has asked for more space, but the total space is needed until the end of the whole project. So the previous 10TB (the record, not the actual disk) has been marked \u0026ldquo;DECOMMISSIONED\u0026rdquo;:\nAn alternative, which might be applicable in some cases, is where the extra space \u0026ldquo;boost\u0026rdquo; is only needed for a shorter period of time, as shown by the different end dates to the 2 requirements below. They\u0026rsquo;re both referring to the same physical storage, but the extra 1 TB space \u0026ldquo;expires\u0026rdquo; first.\nProcessing requests for resource types other than storage \u0026nbsp; The process for reviewing requests for other resource types, such as those needed for cloud tenancies, is the same as above. Further examples may follow here as needed."

        content: "This article describes how you can use \u0026ldquo;virtual environments\u0026rdquo; to install Python packages that are not provided in the common software environments on JASMIN. You might wish to do this if you want to use different packages/versions from those installed on the system, or if you have requested for a package to be installed system-wide but wish to start using it before this request can be acted upon.\nTo decide whether you should use a Python virtual environment or a Conda environment for this purpose, see: overview of software environments.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;virtual environment\u0026rdquo;? \u0026nbsp; A \u0026ldquo;virtual environment\u0026rdquo; is a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python (such as 2.7, 3.7, 3.8), plus a number of additional packages. It provides a very useful method for managing multiple environments on a single platform that can be used by different applications.\nCreating a virtual environment \u0026nbsp; As a pre-requisite, when using any modern Python (i.e. Python2.7 onwards), you should activate a Jaspy environment before following the instructions below.\nPython allows you to create a directory containing a private virtual environment, into which you can install your packages of choice. This is done differently for python2 and python3, as follows:\n# Python 3 onwards: python -m venv /path/to/my_virtual_env # Python 2.7 (deprecated) virtualenv /path/to/my_virtual_env The path can be an absolute or relative path, but it should not already exist. Note: /path/to/my_virtual_env here (and also in the commands shown below) should be replaced by the actual path where you choose to create your virtual environment.\nUsing the system \u0026ldquo;site-packages\u0026rdquo; with your virtual environment \u0026nbsp; Note that if you create a virtual environment using the above syntax, the packages initially installed in it will only be those in the standard Python library. This means, for example, that the numpy package (not in the standard library, but installed as part of Jaspy) will be unavailable unless you install it yourself. If you would prefer as a starting point to have all the add-on packages which have already been installed in Jaspy, then use instead:\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/my_virtual_env This will work for most packages in Jaspy. We have seen situations where one or two packages from Jaspy do not work in private virtual environments, and if you are affected by this then please see the \u0026ldquo;package-specific fixes\u0026rdquo; section below.\nActivating a virtual environment \u0026nbsp; Before the virtual environment can be used, it needs to be \u0026quot; activated \u0026ldquo;. This is done by running the activate script using the source command:\nsource /path/to/my_virtual_env/bin/activate (If you prefer, you can use . instead of source.)\nAfter you run the activate script, some environment variables will be set so that the python (or python2.7 (deprecated), python3) command will point to the one in the virtual environment, allowing installation and use of packages in that environment.\nYou can see that python points to the python executable in the virtual environment, with:\nwhich python /home/users/my_username/my_virtual_env/bin/python Note that you have to source the activate script in every shell (login session) in which you intend to use the virtual environment. If there is a particular virtual environment which you want to use consistently, you might consider putting the command to source the activate script in your $HOME/.bashrc file.\nIf you wish to deactivate the currently active virtual environment in a particular shell, just type deactivate. The environment variable changes will be undone, and you will again be using the system default set of packages. This is also reflected in the shell prompt.\nInstalling packages into a virtual environment \u0026nbsp; Once you have activated a virtual environment, the pip utility will be available. This allows package installation into the environment using the command:\npip install your_package pip is quite flexible what you can use for your_package. It can include:\na package name in the Python Package Index (PyPI)\u0026nbsp; a URL pointing to a package repository the local path of a .tar.gz or .zip file containing the package source the local path of a directory containing the extracted package source the download URL of a .tar.gz or .zip file If the package requires other packages that are not already installed into the virtual environment, then pip will use the package\u0026rsquo;s requirements file to install them automatically from PyPI.\nOne thing to consider when doing this, is that some temporary space is needed by the install process. The location of this temporary space may be set by default to /tmp, which is restricted on the sci machines.\nYou might see this error, despite having ample free space in your own home directory:\nERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: \\ [Errno 122] Disk quota exceededIn order to avoid encountering this, please follow this advice to over-ride the TMPDIR environment variable, setting it to the location of somewhere you know have free space. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to clean up afterwards!\nTo upgrade an existing package, use:\npip install --upgrade your_package If your Python package cannot be installed with pip for any reason, it can also be installed directly from the setup.py file after activating the virtual environment.\npython setup.py install To install a specific version of a package, this can be specified with:\npip install your_package==1.2.3 Inspecting the virtual environment \u0026nbsp; To list the packages installed into the virtual environment, with their version numbers, type:\npip freeze Using the virtual environment \u0026nbsp; Interactive use \u0026nbsp; After you have activated the virtual environment in your shell, any packages that you have installed into it can be imported into an interactive python session.\npython automatically uses python in your virtualenv The prompt changes to \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;:\nimport my_package Scripts \u0026nbsp; If a script is run using the python command on the command-line in a similar way to when starting an interactive Python session, this will use any virtual environment that has been activated in the calling shell.\npython my_script.py If an executable script is run using the #! mechanism, and the first line of the script has the hard-coded path to the executable in the virtual environment, then it is not necessary to activate the virtual environment in the calling shell.\nhead -n 1 myscript.py show the first line #!/path/to/my_virtual_env/bin/python3.7 chmod u+x myscript.py ensure that it is executable ./myscript.py run it As an alternative to hard-coding the path of the virtual environment, it is possible to use the /usr/bin/env approach to ensure that the script is run using whichever python executable is found via $PATH. The script will then run using any virtual environment that has been activated in the calling shell. This makes the script more portable, although at the expense of having to source the activate script.\nhead -n 1 myscript.py #!/usr/bin/env python3.7 chmod u+x myscript.py ./myscript.py Package-specific fixes \u0026nbsp; When using the --system-site-packages option in combination with Jaspy, it has been found that some packages provided by Jaspy (and which work correctly in the Jaspy environment itself) require fixes in order to use them in virtual environments that are created on top of Jaspy. In particular:\nif you use shapely, we suggest to reinstall this into your virtual environment using pip install --ignore-installed shapely after activating the environment if you use geopandas, you will need to reinstall shapely as above, and also when running python you will need to set an environment variable to enable it to find the spatialindex library. After loading Jaspy and activating the virtual environment, you could use either one of the following: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH export LD_PRELOAD=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libspatialindex.so:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libspatialindex_c.so Note that these environment variables could potentially also affect the behaviour of other Linux commands, although unlikely, so you might prefer to set them only for the python session (using a command of the form env variable_name=value python) rather than using export.\nif you use cartopy (also used by iris), you may need to create a symbolic link into your virtual environment to allow the correct loading of libgeos_c.so during import cartopy or import iris. To do this: ln -s $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libgeos_c.so /path/to/my_virtual_env/lib/"

Each consortium has a manager: a representative of that science community who is in touch with its major activities and understands the resource requirements for projects in that domain. Representatives of individual projects should discuss requirements with their Consortium Manager, who is best placed to make decisions about the allocation of JASMIN resources within that consortium. Requirements can be documented using the “JASMIN Resource Management” tool, but need to be approved by a Consortium Manager before being passed to the JASMIN Team for provisioning.\nSee here for further details\u0026nbsp; , including a list of current consortia and their managers.\nAccessing the JASMIN projects portal \u0026nbsp; The JASMIN projects portal\u0026nbsp; provides a place to:\ndocument the resources required for a project (new projects, or changes to existing projects) submit those requirements for review track the provision of those resources Usually, you would only need to access the projects portal if you are:\nthe Principal Investigator (or their delegated project manager) for a project to document requirements for a project to invite other individuals (with a JASMIN account) who may wish to view and/or discuss the requirements a consortium manager to review/approve resource requirements Note: Please do not make requests yourself unless you are involved in the management of the project: speak to the project or group workspace (GWS) manager and ask them to make the request.\nThese users need to log in with their JASMIN account credentials, the same as those used for the JASMIN accounts portal. 2-factor authentication is in use, with verification codes sent to the email address associated with your JASMIN account (this is the same process used to access the JASMIN notebook service).\nOnce you have logged in, you are presented with a view of the projects where you are named as owner or collaborator (or, for consortium managers, where you are the relevant consortium manager). A further guide for consortium managers about how to process requests for resources is available here.\nCreate a project to record resource requirements \u0026nbsp; To create a new project:\nGo to \u0026ldquo;My Projects\u0026rdquo; Click \u0026ldquo;Start new project\u0026rdquo; Enter details for the project, as described below.\nA project can have several Services, such as:\na group workspace a managed cloud tenancy an external cloud tenancy [particular compute requirements*] some services are not yet able to be described/requested via this tool, but will be soon. please contact the helpdesk if you\u0026rsquo;re not able to describe what you need. To add the services needed for the project:\nin the panel on the right, click \u0026ldquo;Add Service\u0026rdquo; select the category of service required: in this case, we\u0026rsquo;re making requirements for a group workspace, but the available options are: Group Workspace (for shared disk storage for a project) External Tenancy VIO (for an external cloud tenancy on the VIO cloud platform) Managed Tenancy VIO (for a managed cloud tenancy on the VIO cloud platform) (please do not use the \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; Tenancy MCP \u0026quot; options as these will soon be removed) provide a short name for the service click \u0026ldquo;create\u0026rdquo;. A Service may have several requirements, but, for example, we could request 10 TB of SOF storage for our GWS:\nSOF (scale-out filesystem) is the usual type of storage used for GWS volumes, but you could also request:\nHPOS (high-performance object store available via an S3-like interface) PFS (parallel file system, by special request if certain workflows specifically need this) SSD (Solid State Disk), used for \u0026ldquo;small files\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;SMF\u0026rdquo; volumes for storing code or virtual environments to share within a GWS. It is assumed that you\u0026rsquo;ve considered carefully how you will do your work on JASMIN, with some knowledge of its services and components. You may find the following helpful:\nArticle: Understanding new JASMIN storage JASMIN workshop\u0026nbsp; overview talk, explaining the main services offered by JASMIN how your request will be scrutinised by the relevant consortium manager. Once created, the requirements appear in the list, along with their start and end dates and status. This one is \u0026ldquo;REQUESTED\u0026rdquo;.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Submit for review\u0026rdquo; and the manager of the relevant consortium will be notified that they need to review the request, with status updated to \u0026ldquo;REQUESTED\u0026rdquo;.\nOnly a user with \u0026ldquo;OWNER\u0026rdquo; status on a project can submit the project for review. It\u0026rsquo;s best if one person coordinates with the consortium manager once the outline plan has been agreed with other project contacts (see inviting another user and joining a project, below)\nIf there are multiple requirements, make sure these are all documented so that the consortium manager can consider them all together, in context. Just repeat the process above for each additional requirement.\nThe project is marked as \u0026ldquo;UNDER REVIEW\u0026rdquo; while the requirements are being agreed.\nThe consortium manager may approve, reject or request changes to the requirements before they are agreed.\nOnce the consortium manager has agreed, the requirements are ready for provisioning: the JASMIN team will then manage the provisioning of the requested resources and the project contact will be notified when this is complete and the new resources available.\nInvite another user \u0026nbsp; By default, information in the projects portal is only visible by those nominated \u0026ldquo;collaborators\u0026rdquo; on the project, the relevant consortium manager, and the JASMIN Team (or others involved in the provision of JASMIN services). To share your plans for what\u0026rsquo;s needed on a project with other individuals, you can invite another user to the project:\nGo to \u0026ldquo;My Projects\u0026rdquo; In the panel on the right, click the link with the number of current collaborators Enter the email address of the other user you wish to invite, and press \u0026ldquo;Invite\u0026rdquo; Although you are inviting them by email address, they must have a JASMIN account in order to access the projects portal. Join an existing project by invitation from another user \u0026nbsp; If you have received an invitation code from an existing collaborator on a project, you can use it to join a project as follows:\nGo to \u0026ldquo;My Projects\u0026rdquo; Click \u0026ldquo;Join existing project\u0026rdquo; Enter the invitation code which the other user has sent you. Request additional resources for an existing project \u0026nbsp; You can add new requirements to a project once it has been PROVISIONED (but not while it\u0026rsquo;s already UNDER_REVIEW).\nTo add new requirements, go to \u0026ldquo;My Projects\u0026rdquo; and create the new requirement.\nFor example, if a GWS currently has 10 TB of SOF space provisioned, and the new and an additional 5 TB of space is needed, then:\nIf the GWS as a whole has the same end date, then create a new requirement for 15TB, with that end date, and submit this so that it can be reviewed. If it\u0026rsquo;s just a temporary / short-term boost of storage that\u0026rsquo;s needed consider whether scratch or XFC storage would suffice create a requirement for the additional storage only, confirming the start and end dates of the new storage in some cases, the end dates of the original storage will be out-of-date, so please agree new dates with your consortium manager as part of this process. Although these examples have concentrated on storage requirements, the same methods apply to requesting cloud tenancies. More detail on how to request these, and additional methods for documenting requirements for compute resources, will follow in due course.\nAlternatives \u0026nbsp; In some cases, it may not be appropriate to provide dedicated resources to certain projects. Your consortium manager should be able to help you look at other options. In some cases, a relevant project may already exist, and by discussion with the appropriate manager of that project, it may be possible for you to make use of those existing resources without the need to create a new one. There is a certain management overhead associated with setting up and operating each project\u0026rsquo;s dedicated services, which use expensive resources, so requests do have to be considered carefully.\nThe following \u0026ldquo;generic\u0026rdquo; Group Workspaces exist for general use by members of these communities and often solve the problem of a small GWS needed by an individual:\nncas_generic\u0026nbsp; : (National Centre for Atmospheric Science) nceo_generic\u0026nbsp; : (National Centre for Earth Observation) ceh_generic\u0026nbsp; : (UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) In these cases, the relevant consortium manager is usually the manager of the \u0026ldquo;generic\u0026rdquo; workspace so can approve applications for access to these workspaces themselves.\nPlease consult the list of available group workspaces\u0026nbsp; for other options.\nAnother alternative, for easily accessible short-term storage for an individual user is the JASMIN Transfer Cache (XFC) service."

        content: "This article tells you about some of the basic transfer tools available for use with JASMIN that work over an SSH connection:\nrsync (over SSH) scp sftp rsync over SSH \u0026nbsp; rsync is a file synchronisation and file transfer program for Unix-like systems that can minimise network data transfer by using a form of delta encoding such that only the differences between and source and destination data are actually transmitted. rsync can compress the data transferred further using zlib compression and SSH or stunnel can be used to encrypt the transfer.\nrsync is typically used to synchronise files and directories between two different systems, one local and one remote. For example, the command:\nrsync mydata remoteuser@remotehost:/data/ will use SSH to connect as remoteuser to remotehost. Once connected, it will invoke another copy of rsync on the remote host, and then the two programmes will talk to each other over the connection, working together to determine which parts of mydata are already on the remote host and don\u0026rsquo;t need to be transferred over the connection.\nThe generic syntax is:\nrsync [OPTION] ... SRC [SRC] ... [USER@]HOST:DEST rsync [OPTION] ... [USER@]HOST:SRC [DEST] \u0026hellip;where SRC is the file or directory (or a list of multiple files and directories) to copy from, and DEST represents the file or directory to copy to. (Square brackets indicate optional parameters.)\nFor more information visit the official rsync website\u0026nbsp; .\nrsync example with JASMIN \u0026nbsp; Here is a simple example using rsync over SSH to your home directory copy a file to a Group Workspace on JASMIN:\nexec ssh-agent $SHELL ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_jasmin # local path to your private key file rsync myfile \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;@xfer-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk:/gws/nopw/j04/myproject/data/ NOTE: The first two lines are the standard method for setting up the SSH agent in order to allow connections without prompting for a passphrase each time.\nscp \u0026nbsp; scp is another basic command-line tool for secure copying between two machines. It is installed as part of most SSH implementations and comes as standard on the JASMIN transfer servers. scp is the secure analogue of the rcp command. Typically, the syntax of scp is like the syntax of cp (copy):\nTo copy a file to a host:\nscp myfile remoteuser@remotehost:directory/target To copy a file (or directory) from a host to the local system:\nscp remoteuser@remotehost:directory/source target scp -r remoteuser@remotehost:directory/source_folder target_folder Note that if the remote host uses a port other than the default of 22, it can be specified in the command. For example, copying a file from host over a non- standard SSH port (2222):\nscp -P 2222 remoteuser@remotehost:directory/source target For more information on scp please visit the following website\u0026nbsp; .\nsftp \u0026nbsp; sftp is a similar command-line tool to scp, but the underlying SFTP protocol allows for a range of operations on remote files which make it more like a remote file system protocol. sftp includes extra capabilities such as resuming interrupted transfers, directory listings, and remote file removal.\nFor basic transfer of a file on JASMIN to the local machine:\nsftp remoteuser@xfer-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk:/group_workspaces/jasmin/myproject/data/notes.txt ./ For more information see the Wikipedia page on SFTP\u0026nbsp; .\nThere are various 3rd-party tools and clients, for example, WinSCP, FileZilla, MobaXterm and others, which can do transfers using the SCP and/or SFTP protocols. Please refer to the documentation for that particular software, but the basic principles are the same, i.e that you can set up a connection to a remote host by specifying the same parameters that you would with the command- line tool, but often through a graphical user interface instead.\nNote on performance \u0026nbsp; While convenient and familiar to many users, the tools described above do not make efficient use of available bandwidth for transferring large quantities of data via high-speed networks over long distances. Please consult Data Transfer Tools to learn more about which might be the most appropriate tool to use in different contexts."

        content: "This article explains how to schedule or automate data transfers. It covers:\nUsing Globus for transfer automation Scheduling download tasks using cron and LOTUS Overview \u0026nbsp; In many cases it can be useful to fetch data from an external source for processing/analysis on JASMIN on a regular basis, for example \u0026ldquo;every Monday at 11:00 fetch all last week\u0026rsquo;s data\u0026rdquo;. It can also be helpful to distribute the task downloading of some large datasets, or simply to be able rely on data being pulled in from some external source to an accumulating dataset used for periodic analysis.\nUsing Globus for transfer automation \u0026nbsp; It is easy to automate transfers using Globus. This method has the advantage that you do not need to remain connected or logged in to any JASMIN server for the automated transfers to take place on your behalf, and the transfer itself can be more efficient than other methods described below.\nSome introductory information about how to do this is available in this article Using the Globus command-line interface (with more to follow) but please also refer to the comprehensive Globus documentation and their automation examples\u0026nbsp; . You can choose whether to schedule/automate tasks via the Globus web interface\u0026nbsp; , command-line interface\u0026nbsp; , or use their Globus Python SDK\u0026nbsp; to build Python code that uses this functionality.\nScheduling download tasks using cron and LOTUS \u0026nbsp; While the cron server cron-01.jasmin.ac.uk is provided for scheduling general tasks, it should not be used for the work of executing those tasks itself, and not for transfer tasks.\nxfer-vm-03 - transfer machine with cron \u0026nbsp; The transfer server xfer-vm-03.jasmin.ac.uk is also provided with cron, and should be used where a task is primarily a transfer rather than a processing task and needs the functionality of a transfer server. Please refer to the above cron guidance for best practice advice.\nIn particular, you must use crontamer to manage your cron jobs.\nInvoking LOTUS from cron to carry out multiple download tasks \u0026nbsp; Sometimes we need a task to be invoked from cron but executed where there are lots of nodes to parallelise the tasks (i.e. the LOTUS cluster). In this case, we DO need to use the cron server rather than the cron-equipped transfer server xfer-vm-03, since we need to be able to submit jobs to LOTUS (the transfer server can\u0026rsquo;t do that).\nThis will only work where the download can happen over HTTP(S), so depends on how the remote data is made available.\nWe need it to:\ninvoke a job submission script at regular intervals have that script initiate downloads using LOTUS nodes In the examples below, we use the test queue (or partition, as queues are known in Slurm). You can use this for testing, but once you know roughly how long your download(s) should take, you should choose an appropriate queue so that the jobs can be scheduled in a fair way alongside other users\u0026rsquo; jobs.\n1. Single download script \u0026nbsp; The simple script below is used to download a single file from an external source via HTTP using wget. It initially uses the test partition (queue), but once you have tested it, you should use a more appropriate queue.\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --partition=test #SBATCH -o %j.out #SBATCH -e %j.err #SBATCH --time=00:30 # executable wget -q -O 1MB_$SLURM_JOBID.zip http://speedtest.tele2.net/1MB.zipIn this example, the file is labelled with the id of the job which downloaded it, e.g. 1MB_61117380.zip\nThe same could be also achieved using curl, or using a Python script making use of (for example) the requests library.\nA note about transfer tools: since we are delegating the actual download task to a LOTUS node, we are restricted to transfer tools already installed on those nodes or available in the user\u0026rsquo;s path at a location cross-mounted with nodes in the LOTUS cluster (see Table 1 in Access to Storage), such as $HOME or a group workspace. It is not possible for the JASMIN team to install specialist data transfer tools across the whole cluster, so you may be limited to downloading via HTTP(S), FTP, or via tools available via libraries in the Python environment such (which you do have access to and can easily customise to install additional libraries using virtual environments).\nDue to networking limitations, LOTUS nodes cannot perform downloads using SSH-based methods, i.e. scp/rsync/sftp.\nDownload tools installed on LOTUS nodes include:\nwget curl ftp (but not lftp) In our simple example above, we can subit this script to LOTUS from the command line with\nsbatch test_download.sh This could be invoked on a regular basis by adding a crontab entry like this\n30 * * * * sbatch /home/users/username/test_download.shHowever it would be safer to wrap this in a crontamer command like this to ensure one instance of the task had finished before the next started: (see Using cron for details)\n30 * * * * crontamer -t 2h \u0026#39;sbatch /home/users/username/test_download.sh\u0026#39; 2. Multi-node downloads \u0026nbsp; We could expand this example to download multiple items, perhaps 1 directory of data for each day of a month, and have 1 element of a job array handle the downloading of each day\u0026rsquo;s data.\nA few words of warning: Distributing download tasks as shown below can cause unintended side-effects. Here, we\u0026rsquo;re submitting an array of 10 download jobs, each initiating a request for a 1MB file which may well happen simultaneously. So we need to be confident that the systems and networks at either end can cope with that. It would be all too easy to submit a task to download several thousand large data files and cause problems for other users of JASMIN (and other users on its host institution\u0026rsquo;s network), or indeed at the other end. Taken to the extreme, this could appear over the network as a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. As with all LOTUS tasks: start small, test, and increase to sensible scales when you are confident it will not cause a problem. A limit of 10 jobs would be a sensible maximum, for one user.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll simulate this here by downloading the same external file to 10 different output files, but you could adapt this concept for your own purposes depending on the layout of the source and destination data.\n#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --partition=test #SBATCH -o %A_%a.out #SBATCH -e %A_%a.err #SBATCH --time=00:30 #SBATCH --array=1-10 #SBATCH --time=00:30 # executable wget -q -O 1MB_$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID.zip http://speedtest.tele2.net/1MB.zip echo \u0026#34;script completed\u0026#34;In this (perhaps contrived) example, we\u0026rsquo;re setting up an array of 10 elements and using the SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID environment variable to name the output files (otherwise they\u0026rsquo;d all be the same). In a real-world example you could apply your own logic to divide up files or directories matching certain patterns to become elements of a job array.\nThe script could then be scheduled to be invoked at regular intervals as shown in (1).\nSome tools provide functionality for mirroring or synchronising directories, i.e. only downloading those files in a directory which are new have been added since the last time a task was run. These can be useful to avoid repeated downloads of the same data."

        content: "Intro \u0026nbsp; The scientific analysis (sci) servers are provided for general purpose use by all users with the jasmin-login access role. The sci servers are not directly accessible outside the firewall of the STFC network (JASMIN\u0026rsquo;s host organisation) so most* users will need to access them via a login server.\nUsers inside the STFC network (e.g. STFC staff on site, or remotely using the STFC VPN) should be able to access them directly.\nAvailable sci servers \u0026nbsp; The following sci servers are available:\nServer name Virtual/Physical Processor model CPU Cores RAM (GB) /tmp max per user /tmp size slurm cluster sci-vm-01 virtual Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6348 CPU @ 2.60GHz 8 32 GB 512 MB 80 GB virtual disk old sci-vm-02 virtual Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6348 CPU @ 2.60GHz 8 32 GB 512 MB 80 GB virtual disk old sci-vm-03 virtual Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6348 CPU @ 2.60GHz 8 32 GB 512 MB 80 GB virtual disk old sci-vm-04 virtual Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6348 CPU @ 2.60GHz 8 32 GB 512 MB 80 GB virtual disk old sci-vm-05 virtual Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6348 CPU @ 2.60GHz 8 32 GB 512 MB 80 GB virtual disk old sci-ph-01 physical AMD EPYC 74F3 48 2 TB 20 GB 2 x 446 GB SATA SSD new sci-ph-02 physical AMD EPYC 74F3 48 2 TB 20 GB 2 x 446 GB SATA SSD new sci-ph-03 physical AMD EPYC 9654 48 1.5 TB 20 GB 480 GB SATA SSD + 800 GB NvMe SSD new Notes \u0026nbsp; 1. Access \u0026nbsp; Sci servers are not exposed outside the STFC network, so from external locations you need to access them via a login server.\nFor users within the STFC network, there is no longer any reverse DNS restriction, so all should be accessible directly within that network without need to go via a login node.\nSee connecting to a sci server via a login server for some alternative methods of connecting.\n2. Physical servers \u0026nbsp; Physical servers are actually re-configured nodes within the LOTUS cluster and as such have different a network configuration from the virtual sci servers, with limited outward connectivity.\nOutbound internet access (via NAT) is only for HTTP(S), so outbound SSH will not work (to hosts outside of JASMIN) on these machines. If you try to git pull/clone from external repositories e.g. Github, the operation will timeout with error fatal: Could not read from remote repository. The solution in this case is to access git pull/clone over HTTPS instead (check the repo for alternative access details).\n3. /tmp on VMs \u0026nbsp; The local /tmp of the virtual sci servers is not available (N/A) for users as this is used by the VM itself. It also provides no performance advantage as it is not local to the server.\n4. Arbiter \u0026nbsp; A monitoring utility \u0026ldquo;Arbiter\u0026rdquo; is implemented across all sci machines to control CPU and memory usage. This utility records the activity on the node, automatically sets limits on the resources available to each user. Users\u0026rsquo; processes are thus capped from using excessive resources, and can be slowed or have memory reduced in response to repeated violations.\n5. Privileges \u0026nbsp; Users are not permitted to execute commands which require administrative privileges. This applies to all hosts in the managed part of JASMIN where users have SSH login access (for example login, nx-login, sci, xfer and hpxfer machines). In other words, the use of su or sudo is not permitted. Please be careful when typing commands, particularly if you have multiple terminal windows open on your own computer, that you do not accidentally attempt sudo on a JASMIN machine: expect some follow-up from the JASMIN team if you do!\nSee also software installed, below.\nPurpose \u0026nbsp; Scientific analysis servers are designed for interactive and ad-hoc analysis of data in group workspaces, the CEDA archive, and users\u0026rsquo; home directories. For long-running and resource-intensive jobs, users are required to use the LOTUS cluster which offers better I/O performance, parallelism, and fair-share scheduling.\nThe following guidelines should be considered when using the scientific analysis servers:\nCheck available resources before your process starts and choose a sci server that is suitable (check average load in the list displayed at the login screen on the login servers, or by using the Linux monitoring commands: top, or free -h ) Execution/processing time should be less than 1 hour Serial jobs only High memory jobs should be executed on the physical servers which have more memory (labelled P in above table). Monitor your process on a sci server using top or ps Linux commands Report if there is a user\u0026rsquo;s process affecting the performance of a scientific server Software installed \u0026nbsp; Each sci server has the following features:\nRocky 9 operating system with development tools. Software packages that make up the JASMIN Analysis Platform are all installed - providing commonly-used open-source analysis tools. These packages include NCO, CDO, Python (with netCDF4, matplotlib, numpy etc.,) and R. Access to proprietary tools, e.g. IDL and Intel Fortran, through the module system. Editors: emacs, vim, nedit, geany and nano are installed. For a more richly-featured editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE), consider using a remote editor locally, for example VSCode\u0026nbsp; or PyCharm\u0026nbsp; : these can be installed and customised on your own machine rather than needing central installation and management on JASMIN. Watch this space for further advice about how to configure and use VSCode in this way. Ability to run graphical applications: use the NX graphical desktop service for best performance. See [Note 4] above about privileges: you can only install software for yourself if it can be done with user-level privileges.\nAccess to storage \u0026nbsp; Each sci server has:\nAccess to the LOTUS /work/scratch-pw* and /work/scratch-nopw2 volumes. Read access to the CEDA Archive according to permissions on your CEDA account. Read/Write access to Group Workspaces according to membership."

        description: "Secondary copy using Elastic Tape",
        
        
        content: "\u0026nbsp; Information below relates to the Elastic Tape command-line tools. The JDMA system provides a better interface for putting/retrieving data into the Elastic Tape System) A new system called NLDS\u0026nbsp; is coming very shortly (as of Feb 2023) and will eventually replace both of these. Introduction \u0026nbsp; Elastic Tape is a system developed for use with JASMIN Group Workspaces (GWSs), enabling the Group Workspace Manager to:\nOptimise their use of high-performance online disk by moving data to and from cheaper near-line storage Create and manage secondary copies of GWS data At present, the system is designed only to be used by GWS Managers, rather than individual members of a GWS. It is the responsibility of a GWS Manager to create and manage backups or additional copies of data in a GWS.\nThe servers used to access Elastic Tape changed in January 2021. Previous users should note that the server to use now is et.jasmin.ac.uk.\nThe maximum size for any file put into Elastic Tape is 500GB. This changed in 2023, when the underlying tape system was upgraded. Please limit your files to less than 500GB.\nWho can use ET? \u0026nbsp; ET is only for use by the named GWS manager, i.e. the individual responsible for managing the GWS disk space. The high-performance disk space used for a GWS is a valuable commodity and the role of the GWS Manager involves making best use of the online space. This may mean moving data to tape to free up space online, or taking a copy of online data to make a secondary copy. No undertaking is provided that the secondary copy will exist beyond the lifetime of the Group Workspace itself, hence it is called a secondary copy and not a backup. It is also NOT long-term archive storage: some data in GWSs may need to be earmarked for longer-term archive storage and wider availability via the CEDA Archive, but this is a separate process for which data management plans, ingest processes and metadata need to be put in place. Please contact the helpdesk if this is the case, but ideally this needs to be considered at project design phase (as it may need funding!).\nEach GWS has a quota of online disk space (agreed at the time of its creation) and initially the ET quota has been set to the same value. So if you have a 10 Tb workspace, you initially have a 10Tb quota of ET storage to match.\nHow does it work? \u0026nbsp; Putting data into ET storage involves creating a \u0026ldquo;batch\u0026rdquo; of data which is transferred to the ET system. Using either a file list or top-level directory for reference, the system calculates resources needed and creates a batch, identified by a batch ID. This must be retained by the GWS manager as a \u0026ldquo;ticket\u0026rdquo; for later retrieval of this batch of data. It is recommended that you assess the data that you plan to transfer so that you have an idea of the overall volume to be transferred before initiating any actual transfer jobs. It is also recommended to test operation with a small set of test data.\nTransparent to the user, and asynchronously (so it is not necessary to wait with a terminal window open), the data are transferred first to online cache and then to tape storage. It is not an instant process and the task of migrating data from online cache to tape can take several hours, even days, depending on factors such as the size of the transfer, contention for the tape system and network conditions. An RSS feed and a web page provide updates on the process of data transfer for each batch. Data can later be retrieved, or removed from ET storage via similar tools.\nThe transfer of data via a batch involves the \u0026ldquo;registration\u0026rdquo; of each file in a database so that its existence is recorded.\nCommand line tools are provided on a dedicated machine within the JASMIN infrastructure, to which GWS managers will be given access. A GWS manager has access to the python tools et_put.py, et_get.py, et_rm.py and et_ls.py. Some initial documentation for these command line tools is attached.\nWhat should I do next? \u0026nbsp; It is recommended to try sending and retrieving some small data transfers (a few Gb) at first using the documentation below, but the system has been designed to cope with storing entire GWSs. You will need ssh login access to et.jasmin.ac.uk first. This should have been arranged for you as part of the GWS setup process. If not, please contact the JASMIN helpdesk. Once there, you should be able to see your group workspace and try out the commands on a small set of test data.\nSystem overview \u0026nbsp; Elastic Tape provides the ability to create \u0026ldquo;batches\u0026rdquo; of files which are then sent to the storage system, initially to an online disk cache before being written to near-line tape. Batches can later be retrieved, or removed. An alert system provides the user with the ability to monitor the progress of transfer jobs.\nThe system comprises:\nA command-line interface on a client machine A backend system, consisting of I/O servers connected to an online disk cache and database A near-line tape system Configuration file \u0026nbsp; As a GWS manager, you will normally be responsible for one or more GWSs. The GWS with which you wish to work using ET needs to be specified either in a configuration file in your home directory, or by specifying the workspace as an option in the command line interface.\nCertain default settings are set in a system-wide config file at /etc/et_config.\nIf needed, you need to create a small text file in your home directory named .et_config, which contains the following, replacing \u0026ldquo;myworkspace\u0026rdquo; with the name of your default workspace:\n[Batch] Workspace = myworkspacemyworkspace should just be the short name of the workspace, not the full path to it.\nThe workspace specified in any command-line option overrides that specified in the user\u0026rsquo;s (~/.et_config) config file, which in turn overrides that specified in the system (/etc/et_config) config file.\nPlease REMOVE any previous reference to host and port from your individual ~/.et_config file. This setting is now set from the system /etc/et_config file.\nFurther configuration options are available in the [DIRECTORY] section of the file, see the system-wide file /etc/et_config for examples. The main parameter for which you may wish to override the default is:\noutputLevel = workspace|batch|filealthough these can be over-ridden at the command line anyway. See et_ls.py command documentation below for the meaning of these options.\nUser interface \u0026nbsp; Please note that NOT ALL features of the currently-implemented user interface are described here, however we would recommend that users limit their usage to those features described below.\nThe user interface consists of the following components:\net_put.py Put data onto tape et_get.py Retrieve data from tape et_rm.py Remove data from tape et_ls.py List data holdings on tape Alerts Get information about processes and holdings via web interface The commands are available on host et.jasmin.ac.uk. As a GWS manager you should have been granted login access to this machine using your JASMIN account, however if accessing the host from outside the RAL network you will need to use one of the login gateways login*.jasmin.ac.uk. Use the -A option or equivalent for agent forwarding in ssh. STFC users may use the STFC VPN to connect to et.jasmin.ac.uk as if it were a local connection.\n\u0026nbsp; When writing data to the ET system, it is very important that data remains in place on disk, in the location where ET expects to find them, until the status of the batch in question has reached CACHED_SYNCED or SYNCED. This means that the data have actually been written to tape, but is not the case until that status is shown.\nThe location where ET expects to find the files will be specified in the LISTFILE that the user supplied to the et_put.py command, or all files and directories under the DIR. The status of user\u0026rsquo;s batches can be checked by going to the webpage: http://et-monitor.fds.rl.ac.uk/et_user/ET_AlertWatch.php\u0026nbsp; . You need to be logged into JASMIN to see this webpage, via the nx-login servers, and use Firefox as the web browser.\nDeleting the data from disk prematurely can cause problems for the ET system as a whole (impacting other users) so please be careful with this aspect.\net_put.py \u0026nbsp; Put data onto tape.\nSynopsis \u0026nbsp; et_put.py [-v] [-l LOGFILE] [-w WORKSPACE] [-c] [-t one-word-tag] [ -f LISTFILE | DIR ] Description \u0026nbsp; Data files to be stored can be specified either in an input list file (-f) or by specifying the path to the top of a directory tree containing files to be stored. All symbolic links are ignored (see note below). In both cases, the system will analyse the request and create a batch , identified by a BATCH ID, which can later be used to retrieve that set of files from storage. Although the main \u0026ldquo;put\u0026rdquo; operation is asynchronous (and does not require you to maintain a terminal connection for its duration), the initial registration step, which creates the BATCH ID is synchronous, so you should wait for this step to complete before disconnecting.\nGiven current resources, all users of Elastic Tape share the current throughput capacity of about 25 TB/day, which may increase over time. Please consider this when organising your input batches and expectations of completion time. Large numbers of small files will degrade performance.\nOptions \u0026nbsp; option details -v Verbose output -l LOGFILE Log file in which to record process output -f LISTFILE Text file containing ABSOLUTE paths of files to be stored, 1 file per line. NB Files and directory names are case-sensitive. The list should not contain any blank lines or extraneous white space. -w WORKSPACE Name of the group workspace to use. Overrides default set in config file. Case sensitive. DIR ABSOLUTE path to top of directory tree containing files to be stored -c Continue if errors encountered. -t tag Tag batch with descriptive label meaningful to user. Should be single one-word string. Appears as \u0026ldquo;Batch name\u0026rdquo; in ET alert output and \u0026ldquo;Tag\u0026rdquo; in et_ls output. Example usage \u0026nbsp; Simple case, using a file input.list which contains paths of all the files to be included in the batch:\net_put.py -v -l et_put.log -f input.list -w myworkspace In the following example, the -coption is used to continue on errors. One error that may be encountered is that a file already exists in the system (e.g. has already been \u0026ldquo;put\u0026rdquo;). This option causes the system to ignore any errors and continue with the transfer. Note that this should not be used by default (we would rather know about errors and fix them!)\net_put.py -v -l et_put.log -f input.list -w myworkspace -c Alternative usage specifying a directory beneath which all files / directories will be included. In this case the directory must be the last parameter in the command:\net_put.py -v -l et_put.log -w myworkspace /group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace/mydir Symbolic links: Attempting to include symbolic links in an et_put operation should cause an error. You can override this with the -c option (although this will ignore ALL errors), but a better solution is to generate a list file as in the first two examples above. If this list file is generated with a command like find \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; -type f \u0026gt; listfile.txt, then referring to it in the et_put command will ensure that only those files are included in the batch. You can then keep the list file (perhaps named as per the resulting batch ID for your own records.\net_get.py \u0026nbsp; Retrieve data from tape\nSynopsis \u0026nbsp; et_get.py [-v] [-l LOGFILE] [-b BATCHID | -f FILELIST] [-w WORKSPACE] [-r DIR] [-t MAXPROC] Description \u0026nbsp; Data files to be retrieved should be specified by referring to the batch ID of the batch in which they were stored. If files have been stored by specifying an absolute path e.g. /group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace/mydir, the retrieval process will not write the retrieved files to the same location but a new location specified by DIR. The final part of the relative path needs to correspond with the first part of the absolute path of the stored files, e.g. group_workspaces\nProposed best-practice is to create a temporary directory for retrieved data within your workspace, e.g. /group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace/ettmp and to do the initial retrieval into that directory. Once you are satisfied that the retrieval has completed correctly, data can be moved back to their original location in the workspace. NB if you need additional storage space for this, please see requesting resources.\nOptions \u0026nbsp; option details -v Verbose output -l LOGFILE Log file in which to record process output. Note that the log file location must be capable of accepting multi-threaded input, or this parameter should be omitted and instead the output from the et_get command be piped to the log file from stdout -b BATCHID ID of batch to be retrieved -f FILELIST A list of individual files to be retrieved, with one file per line. Note that:\n- entries in the list must contain the full name of the file, including path, just as it was archived\n- the list should not contain blank lines or any extraneous white space. -w WORKSPACE name of the group workspace to use. Overrides default set in config file. Case sensitive. -r DIR ABSOLUTE path of retrieval location -t MAXPROC Maximum number of worker processes to use in retrieval. MAXPROC recommended to be between 5 and 10. Please feed back your experience of performance improvement with this feature. Example usage \u0026nbsp; cd /group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace mkdir ettmp et_get.py -v -l et_get.log -w myworkspace -b 507 -r /group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace/ettmp At this point, data will be transferred into the specified retrieval directory. Files and directories will be restored with their ABSOLUTE path below the retrieval directory. NB this is a synchronous process and you will need to keep your terminal window open to ensure it completes (or run within the screen command if you are familiar with this).\nWhen the retrieval process has finished, you should satisfy yourself that it is correct (using your preferred method). When this is the case, you can move the data to the required location as shown below:\nmv /group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace/ettmp/group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace/* /group_workspaces/jasmin/myworkspace et_rm.py \u0026nbsp; Remove data from tape\nSynopsis \u0026nbsp; et_rm.py [-v] -b BATCHID [-w WORKSPACE] Description \u0026nbsp; Deletes the files in the specified batch from the Elastic Tape system.\nOptions \u0026nbsp; option details -v Verbose output -b BATCHID ID of batch to be removed -w WORKSPACE name of the group workspace to use.

        content: "Introduction \u0026nbsp; This article explains how a GWS Manager can organise for some directories within a GWS to be shared with other users on JASMIN.\nNote: this only applies to sharing data within the managed environment of the JASMIN platform. If you need to share data with users outside JASMIN, or to users of external cloud tenancies, please consider the HTTP option.\nHow to share specific directories \u0026nbsp; Sometimes it is useful to share the contents of specific directories within your GWS with other users on JASMIN (that do not have access to your GWS). This can be achieved with the following approach:\nSuppose you manage the GWS /group_workspaces/jasmin/superproj and you want to share the directory /group_workspaces/jasmin/superproj/mydata with other JASMIN users.\n1. Add read and execute permission for all to the top-level GWS directory. This requires root access so you might need to request that CEDA make this change for you:\nchmod 775 /group_workspaces/jasmin/superproj 2. Alter the permissions of all sub-directories to remove the execute permission for all users that don\u0026rsquo;t have access to the GWS:\nfind /group_workspaces/jasmin/superproj -type d -exec chmod o-x  \\; 3. Add execute permission on the sub-directory you want to share:\nchmod o+x /group_workspaces/jasmin/superproj/mydata NOTE: You may need to change permissions on directories and files within the sub-directory as well. Please consult the chmod man pages (by typing man chmod) for details.\nNOTE: if you have a public directory then it needs 755 access if you want it to be visible via the webserver via the gws-access.jasmin.ac.uk service. So you may wish to re-add execute permission on that directory, e.g.:\nchmod o+x /group_workspaces/jasmin/superproj/public \u0026nbsp; Do not set open permissions on files or directories. By this we mean permissions where data are \u0026ldquo;world-writable\u0026rdquo; by anyone, for example\n-rw-rw-rw- for a file, or \u0026laquo; DON\u0026rsquo;T USE THESE!!\ndrwxrwxrwx for a directory. \u0026laquo; DON\u0026rsquo;T USE THESE!!\nWe provide a UNIX a group corresponding to each group workspace, usually named gws_\u0026lt;name\u0026gt; which all members of that GWS belong to: this enables sharing within the group if you set permissions appropriately using that group. If you are unsure about setting permissions, please ask the helpdesk."

        content: "What is HTTP data sharing? \u0026nbsp; Specific parts of JASMIN Group Workspaces (GWSs) can be made available via HTTP, so that:\ndata can be shared with users who do not have JASMIN accounts common clients such as wget, curl, client libraries and web browsers can be used to access the data via a commonly-supported protocol. In this respect, the service should be regarded as another data transfer tool. However it must be arranged in advance between the Group Workspace manager and the JASMIN Helpdesk. It involves:\nA member of the workspace creating a public directory and placing data inside it The GWS manager making a request to the JASMIN Helpdesk to request that this specific GWS is configured to be shared via HTTP. Both these steps need to be completed in order for the GWS to be visible via HTTP. By default, GWSs are not visible by HTTP.\nOnce a GWS has been made available, it is publicly visible by the entire internet: please bear that in mind.\nThe following sections below describe how to set up restricted and unrestricted access to your \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; directory. If you require access control then see the section on password-protected access below. [Note: this is currently possible, though not recommended, only because the current webserver configuration permits this (now deprecated) means of restricting access. Future revisions of the service may remove or change the way access restrictions can be imposed].\n\u0026nbsp; This facility is not to be used for hosting project websites. It is provided as a simple means for specific data files to be made available to a wider audience than members of a Group Workspace, using a convenient data transfer protocol (HTTP). Likewise, it is not recommended to build tools or front-end applications relying on this service as a dependency if they are to be operated as a production or (near-)real-time service. The JASMIN team reserves the right to apply rate-limiting (by project and/or IP address) or to remove GWSs from the service if they are considered to be causing problems for the network or other parts of the service infrastructure.\nProjects considering web-based solutions for showcasing or disseminating their data via more complex tools or with specific availability requirements should consider requesting an external tenancy in the JASMIN Community Cloud, or indeed external service providers if more appropriate, but should be prepared to do the necessary design, development, operation and maintenance of those services themselves.\nPublic access set up \u0026nbsp; In some cases the GWS manager may want to make some files and directories available over HTTP so that users (perhaps a wider audience than just the membership of the GWS) can access the data via a web browser or other HTTP- based tools. This can be done by creating a public directory in the top- level directory of the GWS, for example:\ncd /group_workspace/jasmin/foobaa/ mkdir public chmod -Rf 755 public You should then contact JASMIN Support and ask for this directory to be made visible via the gws-access server. The JASMIN team will configure this change and your public directory will then be visible from:\nhttps://gws-access.jasmin.ac.uk/public/foobaa/\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; The URL of this service changed in June 2020. A redirect is in place from the old URL of https://gws-access.ceda.ac.uk/, so the change should be transparent to existing users, but please use the new URLs beginning with https://gws-access.jasmin.ac.uk/ to avoid any problems for example with HTTP clients that are unable to handle redirects. Please see the section below if you wish to control who can access the content of one or more of the sub-directories within your public directory.\nRestricted access set up \u0026nbsp; In order to restrict access to your \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; directory, and/or any sub- directories, you will need to create an \u0026ldquo;.htaccess\u0026rdquo; file within it. In turn, the \u0026ldquo;.htaccess\u0026rdquo; file must point to a \u0026ldquo;.htpasswd\u0026rdquo; file which lists the usernames and encrypted passwords that have read-access to that directory.\n\u0026nbsp; This method of access control is entirely independent of the SSH login accounts used on JASMIN and would be the responsibility of the GWS Manager to maintain. It is not secure by modern standards and not particularly recommended as it adds complication for GWS managers and users, but is an option for some basic access control if no other options are available.\nFuture revisions of the service may revise or remove this feature.\nIn order to create the \u0026ldquo;.htpasswd\u0026rdquo; file, you will need access to the \u0026ldquo;htpasswd\u0026rdquo; command. This is available on the transfer servers xfer[12].jasmin.ac.uk\nYou can then create the \u0026ldquo;.htpasswd\u0026rdquo; file as follows (using the example of a Group Workspace called \u0026ldquo;foobaa\u0026rdquo;):\n\u0026nbsp; The htpasswd tool is going to be put on the new sci and xfer-vm servers shortly, but please use it on the old ones (e.g sci1) for now. export GWS=/group_workspaces/jasmin/foobaa/ cd $GWS mkdir -p public cd public htpasswd -b -m -c $GWS/public/.htpasswd i_am_a_user i_am_a_password Before this will work, you also need to create a \u0026ldquo;.htaccess\u0026rdquo; file which you could do as follows\ncat \u0026gt;.htaccess \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOL AuthType Basic AuthName \u0026#34;Password Required\u0026#34; AuthUserFile /group_workspaces/jasmin/foobaa/public/.htpasswd Require valid-user EOL Finally, change the permissions on these files:\nchmod 644 .htaccess .htpasswd Now, you can test that you get prompted for the username and password by visiting\nhttps://gws-access.jasmin.ac.uk/public/foobaa/\u0026nbsp;"

In the context of JASMIN, there are a number of Python/other environments already available on the system. See the Jaspy page for examples of these.\nCreating software environments on JASMIN \u0026nbsp; In some cases, JASMIN users will need to create their own software environments because the existing environments do not include all the packages that they require. See the virtual environments page for details on creating your own Python environments.\nTips on sharing software environments on JASMIN \u0026nbsp; If you need to create your own environment it is important to be aware of which file system you are working on:\nSOF (e.g. /gws/nopw/j04/*): does not perform well with small files. SSD (e.g. $HOME and /gws/smf/j04/*): performs much better with small files, but is expensive so only limited quotas are available. If you are building an environment for your use only then it makes sense to create it under your $HOME directory.\nIf you need to share an environment with other JASMIN users you can:\nRequest a \u0026ldquo;small files\u0026rdquo; (smf) Group Workspace volume. Install the software environment within the \u0026ldquo;small files\u0026rdquo; volume. Then all users with access to that GWS will be able to access the environment."

A full breakdown of each queue and its associated resources is shown below in Table 1.\nQueue details \u0026nbsp; Queues represent a set of pending jobs, lined up in a defined order, and waiting for their opportunity to use resources.

The default queue is short-serial\nshort-serial \u0026nbsp; Serial and/or array jobs with a single CPU core each and run time less than 24 hrs should be submitted to the short-serial queue . This queue has the highest priority of 30. The maximum number of jobs that can be scheduled to start running from the short-serial is 2000 jobs whilst both job\u0026rsquo;s resources are available and user\u0026rsquo; priority is high\nlong-serial \u0026nbsp; Serial or array jobs with a single CPU core and run time greater than 24 hrs and less than 168 hrs (7 days) should be submitted to the queue long-serial . This queue has the lowest priority of 10 and hence jobs might take longer to be scheduled to run relatively to other jobs in higher priority queues.\nhigh-mem \u0026nbsp; Serial or array jobs with a single CPU core and high memory requirement (\u0026gt; 64 GB) should be submitted to the high-mem queue and the required memory must be specified --mem=XXX (XXX is in MB units). The job should not exceed the maximum run time limit of 48hrs. This queue is not configured to accept exclusive jobs.\nParallel queues \u0026nbsp; Jobs requiring more than one CPU core should be submitted to one of the following parallel queues depending on the type of parallelisms such as shared memory or distributed memory jobs.\npar-single \u0026nbsp; Shared memory multi-threaded jobs with a maximum of 16 threads should be submitted to the par-single queue . Each thread should be allocated one CPU core. Oversubscribing the number of threads to the CPU cores will cause the job to run very slow. The number of CPU cores should be specified via the submission command line sbatch -n \u0026lt;number of CPU cores\u0026gt; or by adding the Slurm directive #SBATCH -n \u0026lt;number of CPU cores\u0026gt;in the job script file. An example is shown below:\nsbatch --ntasks=4 --partition=par-single \u0026lt; myjobscript Note: Jobs submitted with a number of CPU cores greater than 16 will be terminated (killed) by the Slurm scheduler with the following statement in the job output file:\npar-multi \u0026nbsp; Distributed memory jobs with inter-node communication using the MPI library should be submitted to the par-multi queue . A single MPI process (rank) should be allocated a single CPU core. The number of CPU cores should be specified via the Slurm submission command flag sbatch -n \u0026lt;number of CPU cores\u0026gt; or by adding the Slurm directive #SBATCH -n \u0026lt;number of CPU cores\u0026gt; to the job script file. An example is shown below:\nsbatch --ntasks=4 --partition=par-multi \u0026lt; myjobscript Note 1: The number of CPU cores gets passed from Slurm submission flag -n . Do not add the -np flag to mpirun command .\nNote 2: Slurm will reject a job that requires a number of CPU cores greater than the limit of 256."

        content: "What is a Job Scheduler? \u0026nbsp; A job or batch scheduler, is a tool that manages how user jobs are queued and run on a set of compute resources. In the case of LOTUS the compute resources are the set of compute nodes that make up the LOTUS hardware. Each user can submit jobs to the scheduler which then decides which jobs to run and where to execute them. The scheduler manages the jobs to ensure that the compute resources are being used efficiently and that users get appropriate access to those resources.\nThe Slurm Scheduler \u0026nbsp; Slurm\u0026nbsp; is the job scheduler deployed on JASMIN. It allows users to submit, monitor, and control jobs on the LOTUS cluster.\nGeneral principles for working with Slurm \u0026nbsp; Before learning how to use Slurm, it is worthwhile becoming familiar with the basic principles of scheduler operation in order to get the best use out of the LOTUS cluster. Scheduler software exists simply because the amount of jobs that users wish to run on a cluster at any given time is usually greatly in excess of the amount of resources available. This means that the scheduler must queue jobs and work out how to run them efficiently.\nSeveral factors are taken into account during scheduling, such as job duration and size, but the basic principles remain the same throughout - every user gets a fair share of the cluster based on the jobs that they have submitted. This leads to a small number of important principles:\nDo not try to second guess the scheduler! Submit all of your jobs when you want to run them and let the scheduler figure it out for you. You will get a fair share, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t then we need to adjust the scheduler (so get in touch and let us know). Give the scheduler as much information as possible. There are a number of optional parameters (see How to submit jobs) such as job duration, and if you put these in then you have an even better chance of getting your jobs to run. It is very difficult for one user to monopolise the cluster, even if they submit thousands of jobs. The scheduler will still aim to give everyone else a fair share, so long as there are other jobs waiting to be run. Fair share for all users \u0026nbsp; Example of scheduling In the example above, three users (left column) have jobs in the queue (middle column) which are waiting to run on the cluster (right column). As the blue user\u0026rsquo;s job finishes (middle row), all three users could potentially use the two job slots that become available. However, the orange and purple users already have jobs running, whereas the blue user does not, and as such it is the blue user\u0026rsquo;s jobs that are run (bottom row).\nLOTUS queues \u0026nbsp; There are five standard Slurm queues (also known as \u0026ldquo;partitions\u0026rdquo; in Slurm terminology) for batch job submissions to the LOTUS cluster: short-serial, long-serial, par-single, par-multi and high-mem. The default queue is short-serial. For testing new workflows, the additional queue testis recommended. The specification of each queue is described in detail in this article: Slurm queues on LOTUS\nQueues other than the five standard queues with the test queue should be ignored unless you have been specifically instructed to use them.\nThe typical workflow for LOTUS jobs \u0026nbsp; One of the great advantages of using JASMIN is the ability to create batch jobs that run simultaneously on multiple LOTUS nodes. However, users familiar with running interactively on a single machine often take time to adapt to this new way of working. The change involves moving from a \u0026ldquo;watching your job run\u0026rdquo; approach to \u0026ldquo;submitting your job and coming back later\u0026rdquo;.\nThe typical workflow for setting up and running LOTUS jobs is as follows:\nLogin to one of the scientific analysis servers. Install/write/configure your processing code. Test your code interactively: run it locally in a single-process test case. Create a wrapper script for your code that allows multiple versions to run independently: e.g. running for different dates or processing different spatial regions/variables. Submit your jobs via the batch script. Monitor your jobs. Gather/analyse/review the outputs as required. Project-specific LOTUS queues \u0026nbsp; Occasionally a project has a specific requirement for a collection of compute nodes that involve the provision of a project-specific queue. If you are working on such a project your project lead will provide guidance on which queue to use. Please contact the helpdesk if you are interested in setting up a project-specific queue."

        content: "JASMIN employs SSH public key authentication for login instead of username and password. This article provides a basic overview of public key authentication.\nPublic key authentication (for SSH) \u0026nbsp; SSH stands for \u0026ldquo;Secure Shell\u0026rdquo;, a protocol that allows login to another computer over the network. This allows the user to execute commands on a remote machine. SSH uses encryption to keep the connection secure so that it is more difficult for hackers to passwords or other sensitive information that may pass through the connection.\nPublic key authentication is an alternative means of identifying yourself to a login server, instead of typing a password. It is more secure and flexible, but can appear more difficult for new users.\nWhy is public key authentication more secure than a password? \u0026nbsp; When using conventional username/password authentication you will type your password when you log on to a server. If the server you are working on has been compromised then an attacker could learn your password and then use it to gain access to the remote server you are connecting to.\nWith public key authentication, the private key is kept only on your own machine and the passphrase to unlock it is entered there too. An attacker would require both knowledge of the passphrase used to protect your private key as well as the private key file itself.\n\u0026nbsp; It is imperative that your private key is protected by a strong passphrase so that only you can use it. Public key authentication setup \u0026nbsp; Setting up SSH keys involves the following steps:\nCreate a pair of SSH keys (public and private with associated passphrase ). Provide the public key to remote machines/services that you wish to login to. See instructions for setting this up on JASMIN.\nLogin with your SSH key pair \u0026nbsp; Once you have set up your key pair and provided your public key to the remote machine the process is as follows:\nLoad the private key into an \u0026ldquo;authentication agent\u0026rdquo; (such as ssh-agent) on your local machine. Use an SSH client (such as the ssh command) to login to the remote server. See instructions for setting this up on JASMIN.\nLogging in from multiple machines \u0026nbsp; If you have a requirement to login to your JASMIN account from multiple servers/locations then please copy your private key file securely to the ~/.ssh directory on the new machine. Note that you should restrict access the private key so it is only readable by you.\nUsing public key authentication with other applications \u0026nbsp; Many other tools use the SSH protocol for their communication with remote servers or services, for example rsync, scp, git and subversion."

        content: "Introduction \u0026nbsp; This article describes the jasmin-sci software environment on JASMIN. It covers the following topics:\nOverview of the jasmin-sci software environment Activating and deactivating the jasmin-sci environment Using the jasmin-sci environment with Jaspy Overview of the \u0026ldquo;jasmin-sci\u0026rdquo; software environment \u0026nbsp; The jasmin-sci software environment is intended as a supplement to Jaspy and contains extra software packages for use with scientific data analysis which, for various reasons, are not provided as part of Jaspy itself. These packages are generally installed on the same machines where Jaspy is available, for example, the sci machines (e.g. sci*.jasmin.ac.uk) and LOTUS nodes, but not the login machines. It is not intended for the jasmin-sci environment itself to provide a complete suite of analysis software.\nThe packages included in jasmin-sci are provided via RPMs. A list of explicitly included packages can be seen using the command rpm -qR jasmin-sci, although some additional packages may be installed to satisfy dependencies.\nThe packages fall into two categories:\nPackages provided by standard RPM repositories (example \u0026ldquo;gnuplot\u0026rdquo;) - these are installed into ordinary system paths (such as /usr/bin/gnuplot for the gnuplot program) and require no special setup in order to run. So if you are on a relevant machine, you should just be able to type gnuplot. Packages which we have built locally for use on JASMIN (although most are third-party software). To avoid any potential later conflicts with standard packages, they are installed under the path /opt/rh/jasmin-sci/ rather than in system paths. Also, the RPM package names, as can be seen in the above rpm -qR jasmin-sci command, are prefixed with jasmin-sci-. So for example, the local build of nccmp (a program to compare netCDF files) is a package called jasmin-sci-nccmp, and the executable is at /opt/rh/jasmin-sci/root/usr/bin/nccmp. Before these packages can be conveniently used, it is necessary to \u0026ldquo;activate\u0026rdquo; the environment as described below, so that when you type e.g. \u0026ldquo;nccmp\u0026rdquo; the relevant files can be found. Unlike the Jaspy environments, jasmin-sci can only provide one version of each package at a time, so the versions are subject to change when updates are done. If we anticipate any important changes, then we will notify JASMIN users by email.\nIn a few cases, software packages are provided in jasmin-sci which are also provided in Jaspy. This is only done where other RPM packages depend on it. For example, the netcdf package is provided in Jaspy, but is also installed as an RPM because the nccmp package requires it. This means that copies of the netCDF libraries exist both in Jaspy (for the full path, type nc-config --libs after activating Jaspy) and also under /usr/lib64 (from the RPM). When linking code to the netCDF library, it is recommended to use the one in Jaspy because this will be version controlled. Also, although the jasmin-sci software might provide some software that happens to be implemented in Python, any such Python modules are not intended to be imported into your own code. For Python development, packages from Jaspy should be used.\nThe development for jasmin-sci takes place via the extra-sci-packages\u0026nbsp; GitHub repository, and an associated issues\u0026nbsp; page. The readme file on the repository has some package-specific documentation (including how to build the python bindings for Misr toolkit).\nActivating and deactivating the \u0026ldquo;jasmin-sci\u0026rdquo; environment \u0026nbsp; To activate the jasmin-sci environment, use the command:\nmodule load jasmin-sci and to deactivate it, use the command:\nmodule unload jasmin-sci (\u0026ldquo;add\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;purge\u0026rdquo; can also be used).\nThe module load command must be done in each session, or added to your $HOME/.bashrc file.\nAs mentioned above, this is only required for a subset of packages in jasmin- sci. The majority of packages do not require it, but for example, those which do include ferret, and the leafpad (notepad-like) editor.\nFerret users should note that it is still necessary to do \u0026ldquo;source ferret_paths.sh\u0026rdquo; after activating jasmin-sci, in order for ferret to find all its additional resource files.\nUsing the \u0026ldquo;jasmin-sci\u0026rdquo; environment with Jaspy \u0026nbsp; To activate both jasmin-sci and Jaspy, it is best to activate them in the following order:\nmodule load jasmin-sci module load jaspy This will ensure that in the unlikely event of an executable in Jaspy also existing under /opt/rh/jasmin-sci/, then one in Jaspy will take priority.\nThe corresponding module unload commands can be done in either order."

        content: "The JASMIN Notebook Service has recently been updated to include a GPU-enabled node. This means that JASMIN users can now run Machine Learning (ML) workflows in Notebooks. This page outlines:\nWho can access the GPU-enabled Notebooks Service? \u0026nbsp; The service is available to all JASMIN users that have been granted access to the ORCHID (GPU) cluster. Existing JASMIN users can apply here\u0026nbsp; .\nStarting a Notebook Server with GPUs \u0026nbsp; In order to start a Notebook Server with GPUs enabled, go to the initial start page and click on the \u0026ldquo;Launch Server\u0026rdquo; button:\nNotebook server start page Then select the \u0026ldquo;GPU\u0026rdquo; option and click \u0026ldquo;Start\u0026rdquo;:\nSelecting the GPU notebook server Which packages are available by default? \u0026nbsp; Check the top-right corner of a Notebook session to see which kernel that is being used. If you don\u0026rsquo;t need any specialist Machine Learning (ML) libraries, you would typically choose Python 3 + Jaspy as this has many of the common open-source packages used within environmental science:\nNotebook kernel You can click on the name of the kernel to select a different one.\nIf you want to work with GPUs, you are likely to want to install other packages that are common in ML, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. This topic is discussed below.\nGPU availability \u0026nbsp; In order to check that your notebook is running on a server with GPUs, you can use the built-in NVIDIA commands, such as:\n!nvidia-smiIf GPUs are enabled, the output should look like this:\nOutput from the nvidia-smi command Understanding the nvidia-smi command output \u0026nbsp; 1. The Header section \u0026nbsp; The first section includes:\nCUDA Version: 12.7: The version of the CUDA toolkit that the NVIDIA driver supports. GPU 0 / GPU 1: There are two physical NVIDIA A100 GPUs in the system. Name: The model is NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB. Each GPU has 40GB of on-board memory. Memory-Usage: Shows N/A because these GPUs are in MIG mode (Multi-Instance GPU), so memory usage is not reported here in the usual way. Memory usage for MIG slices is shown in the dedicated MIG section (below). GPU-Util: Also N/A for the same reason (MIG is active, so usage must be looked at per MIG instance). 2. The MIG section \u0026nbsp; The second section introduces MIG (Multi-Instance GPU)\u0026nbsp; . When a GPU is running in MIG Mode, it allows each GPU to be partitioned into multiple instances, each acting as a smaller independent, or virtual, GPU. Because MIG is turned on, you see \u0026ldquo;N/A\u0026rdquo; in the normal memory usage fields. Instead, you have a dedicated table for each MIG device:\nGPU: This repeats the GPU ID (0 or 1). GI ID (GPU Instance) and CI ID (Compute Instance): Each MIG slice is defined by a GPU instance and a compute instance. MIG Dev: The MIG device index. Memory-Usage (13MiB / 9984MiB): Each MIG slice here is allocated around 10GB (9984MiB) of GPU memory. Currently, only 13 MiB is being used, likely overhead. BAR1-Usage: This is the amount of memory mapped via the BAR1 aperture (used for buffer transfers). CE / ENC / DEC / OFA / JPG: These columns refer to hardware encoder/decoder and other specialized engines available to each MIG slice. 3. The Processes section \u0026nbsp; The third section, processes, indicates what is running on the GPU/MIG instances:\nNo running processes found: There were no active workloads on the GPUs or MIG instances at the time this command was run. In short: There are two physical A100 GPUs. Each is in MIG mode and is presenting one virtual GPU instance with 10GB of memory. Currently, neither GPU has any running processes, so they\u0026rsquo;re essentially idle. The top-level memory usage fields are \u0026ldquo;N/A\u0026rdquo; because MIG splits the GPU resources, and the usage is shown in the MIG devices table below.\nGetting the GPU and MIG device IDs \u0026nbsp; The following command will give you the exact IDs of the available GPUs and MIG instances:\n!nvidia-smi -LThe output will be something like:\nGPU 0: NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB (UUID: GPU-2927d07e-3fe9-7904-9e08-b08b82d9a37d) MIG 1g.10gb Device 0: (UUID: MIG-6e95ef19-5145-571b-b040-7e731f1c1af3) GPU 1: NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB (UUID: GPU-e109d8d9-923e-7235-0429-96b7fdbcbd30) MIG 1g.10gb Device 0: (UUID: MIG-b4bcd4f3-6f69-516d-9404-b5ada80d760b) Resource allocation \u0026nbsp; The current allocation of GPUs to the JASMIN Notebook Service is as follows:\n1 GPU Node serves 4 physical GPUs (NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB). Each GPU is partitioned, using MIG, into 4 virtual GPU instances. Each user is allocated 2 virtual GPU instances for their own notebook instance. Each virtual GPU instance has 10GiB of memory. Software environments and Machine Learning packages \u0026nbsp; In the current release of the Notebook Service, users are required to install their own ML packages for use with GPUs. We recommend this approach:\nCreate a virtual environment (\u0026quot;venv\u0026quot;), for example ml-venv. Use our guide to help you. Install the packages you require into that venv. For example, if you needed pytorch and torchvision, you would run pip install torch torchvision (including specific versions if needed). NOTE: Many ML packages are very big - this can take several minutes. Be sure to follow the instructions for installing ipykernel into your venv and running the relevant command to install the kernel so that JupyterHub can locate it and list it as one of the available kernels. Use the name of your venv as the name of the kernel. Once you have installed your kernel, it should appear as an option in the Launcher as outlined in green in the diagram below. The Launcher is accessible from the File menu. Handling multiple/conflicting versions of software packages \u0026nbsp; It is common to find that different workflows will require different versions of software packages. In the fast-moving world of ML, the libraries and their dependencies often change and this can cause problems when trying to work within a single software environment.\nIf you encounter this kind of problem, we recommend that you create multiple virtual environments and their associated kernels. You can then select the appropriate kernel for each notebook. It may also be worth investing the time in capturing exact versions of the relevant packages so that you can reproduce your environment if necessary. Python packages often use a requirements file (typically named requirements.txt) to capture the dependencies. For example:\nscikit-learn==1.5.1 torch==2.5.1+cu124 torchvision==0.20.1+cu124All packages listed in a requirements file can be installed with a single command:\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt Importing PyTorch or TensorFlow and testing that they work with CUDA \u0026nbsp; CUDA is system that connects the Python libraries to the GPU system (on NVIDIA hardware). When we install PyTorch, or many other ML packages, it should automatically detect CUDA if it is available. Assuming that you have followed the instructions to create a venv and install PyTorch, then you can check for CUDA with:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; import torch \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(\u0026#34;Is CUDA available? \u0026#34;, torch.cuda.is_available()) Is CUDA available? TrueThe same thing is possible with TensorFlow:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; import tensorflow as tf \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices(\u0026#39;GPU\u0026#39;)) [PhysicalDevice(name=\u0026#39;/physical_device:GPU:0\u0026#39;, device_type=\u0026#39;GPU\u0026#39;), PhysicalDevice(name=\u0026#39;/physical_device:GPU:1\u0026#39;, device_type=\u0026#39;GPU\u0026#39;)] Warning about large ML packages and HOME directory disk quota \u0026nbsp; Please be aware that installing these packages into your $HOME directory will require multiple gigabytes of free space. If you are near your quota (100GB), then the installation may fail. It is important to note that an installation failure may not report a violation of disk quota even if that is the underlying problem.\nSee the HOME directory documentation for details on checking your current disk usage.\nGuidelines and Best Practices \u0026nbsp; Efficient GPU usage \u0026nbsp; Please make use of GPUs efficiently in your code. If you only need CPUs, then please use the standard Notebook service. One way to ensure that the resource is being efficiently used is to stop your notebook server, via the Hub Control Panel (see the File menu) when not actively needed. Be sure to save your notebook before stopping the server.\nMemory and Resource Limits \u0026nbsp; The per-user memory limit for a given notebook is given in the bar below (typically 16GB). On the GPU architecture there is 10GiB per virtual GPU.\nScaling up your workflows \u0026nbsp; Experienced JASMIN users will be familiar with the resource limitations of the Notebook Service. Whilst it is great for prototyping, scientific notebooks and code-sharing, it does not suit large multi-process and long-running workflows. The LOTUS cluster is provided for larger workflows, and it includes the ORCHID partition for GPU usage.\nWe recommend that you use the GPU-enabled Notebook Service to develop and prototype your ML workflows, and migrate them to ORCHID if they require significantly more compute power. Please contact the JASMIN Helpdesk if you would like advice on how to migrate your workflows.\nGetting Advice on Machine Learning \u0026nbsp; For advice on machine learning packages and suitability for different applications, you could make use of the NERC Earth Observation Data Analysis and AI service (NEODAAS). See the NEODAAS website\u0026nbsp; for details.\nA Notebook to get started \u0026nbsp; An introductory notebook, which includes most of the information provided on this page, is available on GitHub\u0026nbsp; . It may provide a useful starting point for your journey."

        content: "These tips for new users are based on users\u0026rsquo; queries encountered by our helpdesk. They are not exhaustive but may help solve some initial problems and set out best practice.\nSci machines LOTUS Xfer servers How to report an issue \u0026ldquo;Sci\u0026rdquo; machines usage guidelines \u0026nbsp; Check the current load and number of users on the sci machines, as shown by the login servers, to select a less-used sci machine. The available Sci machines and their specifications are listed in the table of this help page The sci machines are not for running large, long-running tasks, or scripts that spawn multiple child processes. The batch processing cluster LOTUS is available for heavier processing. The sci machines are for development, testing, and light interactive use. Overloading these with processing seriously impairs performance for interactive use by others. Do not write to the temporary partition /tmpon sci machines. Use your home directory, a scratch volume or a Group Workspace . Any temporary data files can reside in a subdirectory of your group workspace instead of /tmp. To do this, please add the following lines (or similar) to your $HOME/.bashrc file: export TMPDIR=/group_workspaces/jasmin/\u0026lt;your_project\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;your_username\u0026gt;/tmp ## create the directory if needed [ -d $TMPDIR ] || mkdir -p $TMPDIR If a process hangs, do not simply close the terminal window. Please contact the helpdesk and alert the team so that the process can be shut down. Otherwise hung processes build up and contribute to machine overloading. Do not “hog” IDL development licenses. A limited number of these are available for development and compilation of IDL code which should then be run on LOTUS using IDL runtime licenses, of which there are many more. Do not use sci machines for data transfer: xfer hosts are provided for this purpose. LOTUS usage guidelines \u0026nbsp; Do not use IDL development licences on LOTUS. There are many runtime licenses available, but the development licenses are for interactive use on the sci machines, where IDL code can be compiled, then run on LOTUS using a runtime license. Beware of inadvertently filling up /tmp on LOTUS nodes. This can take nodes out of action (perhaps for other users who still have jobs running on the same node) if /tmp fills up. Design your code to clean up as it goes along, and use environment variables to control where your applications write temporary data, ideally to storage which is not specific to a LOTUS node. If your job crashes, check which nodes were involved and clean up after yourself. Do not store data in scratch areas for long periods of time. Move data away to group workspaces once your processing has finished. Xfer servers guidelines \u0026nbsp; Do not run a large number (\u0026gt;16) of rsync or scp transfer processes in parallel. Do not run processing on xfer servers: they are provided for data transfer only For heavy/high-performance data transfers, use Globus or one of the hpxfer servers. How to report an issue \u0026nbsp; When you do experience an issue, please;\nMake it clear whether you are simply advising the helpdesk of a general issue (which will be noted, but not necessarily investigated for a specific response), or Provide FULL and SPECIFIC details of your problem so that it can be investigated. JASMIN is a complex infrastructure with many hundreds of hosts and storage volumes, so reporting that “JASMIN” or “Storage” is slow, is not sufficient. If you are experiencing difficulties accessing a particular storage volume from a particular sci machine, please state: the full path to the data you are trying to access: the full hostname of the machine (but please try the same access from at least one other machine to help establish whether it’s related to the machine or the storage) the date and time of the issue (for matching up with system reports/log files. Using the date and time of the email is not sufficient: please be specific in your report) Be patient: sometimes, queries will take longer to resolve if they are complex or if relevant staff are not available. Some issues will only be resolved by strategic improvements which are planned as part of phased upgrades to JASMIN accompanied by capital procurements followed by integration work, all carried out by the same, small team."

        description: "Transfer Cache (XFC)",
        
        
        content: "What is the XFC? \u0026nbsp; The Transfer Cache (XFC) provides a large area of temporary storage for users of JASMIN to store large files and/or a large volume of files on a short-term basis.\nUsers are granted a quota of space in their user area on the temporary storage. When users exceed their quota some of their files will be deleted automatically.\nUsers interact with the XFC in two ways:\nto initialise their user area, and to get information about their quota, a command-line client is used. to move data in and out of their user area, the standard UNIX command-line tools (cp, mkdir, rm, mv, rsync, etc.) are used. Quotas \u0026nbsp; XFC has two different types of quota. The first is the \u0026ldquo;hard quota\u0026rdquo; (HQ). This is the absolute maximum volume of data that can be stored in the user area. This is expressed in TB (terabytes).\nThe second type of quota is the \u0026ldquo;temporal quota\u0026rdquo; (TQ). This is expressed in units of TB day (terabyte days), and has a time component as well as a data volume component. For an individual file, the TQ for that file is the product of the size of the file and the number of days the file has been in the user area. As an example, if the user moves a 2TB file into their area, after 24 hours it will have used 2TB days of the TQ. After 48 hours it will have used 4TB days and after 1 week it will have used 14TB days.\nFinally, any file in the XFC can have a maximum persistence of 365 days. i.e. if a file is in XFC for more than one year then it will be deleted by the automatic deletion.\nThe above figure shows an example of the quota system in use. The red line shows the temporal quota used (TQ) and the blue line shows the hard quota (HQ).\nThe user initialises their XFC. On day 5 , the user copies a 1 TB file into their XFC For the next 4 weeks (on days 12 , 19 , 26 and 31 ) the user copies in another 1 TB file The TQ steadily grows until on day 79 it has reached its limit of 300TB days, the first 1TB file is deleted On day 98 another 1TB file is deleted On day 120 , the user copies 10TB into their XFC On days 122 , 130 and 140 the 1TB files that were copied in on days 19 , 26 and 31 are deleted. On day 151 , the 10TB file is deleted. Default Quota values: \u0026nbsp; The default Hard Quota (HQ) is 10 TB\nThe default Time Quota (TQ) is 300 TB\nSo you could store 10TB of data for 30 days before risking the deletion of data.\nAdditionally, an overall time limit of 365 days is set for ALL data stored by a given user. You cannot store any data, no matter how small, for longer than 365 days.\nAutomatic deletion \u0026nbsp; If users exceed either their temporal quota or hard quota, then files in their user area will be deleted automatically. The deletion process will delete as many files as necessary to bring the amount of HQ and TQ below the quotas allocated to the user. Files will be deleted on an age basis. Those files that were copied into the user area first will be deleted first, with newer files deleted after these.\nThe user can be notified which files will be deleted if they switch the option to be notified on and supply an email address in the XFC client. Files will be deleted 24 hours after the notification.\nIf a file is modified between the notification and the scheduled deletion (24 hours later) then the file will not be deleted. However, the automatic deletion is relentless and it will choose some other file to delete instead. XFC is not designed as permanent storage and the automatic deletion process has been designed to discourage long term storage of files on it.\nUsing XFC \u0026nbsp; JASMIN provides access to XFC via a command-line client: xfc\nOnce installed into your $HOME directory (using one of the sci servers), the xfc client can be run on either the sci (sci*.jasmin.ac.uk) or xfer (xfer*.jasmin.ac.uk) servers, but should NOT be run on the high-performance transfer servers hpxfer*.jasmin.ac.uk.\nThe client is used only for interacting with the service, but is not needed for accessing the storage it provides. The storage provided is mounted in most places across JASMIN: the path to your XFC volume is returned by the client in one of the steps shown below.\nUsers are expected to use the xfer servers or a high-performance data transfer service to do any data transfers either within or in/out of JASMIN. This reduces the load on the sci servers which are for general-purpose interactive computing.\nThe xfc client is used to initialise and then query the status (quota, scheduled deletions etc) of a user\u0026rsquo;s XFC storage volume:\nTo see all the available options: xfc -h To initialise your user area: xfc init xfc init ** SUCCESS ** - user initiliazed with: username: username email: user.name@stfc.ac.uk quota: 300TB path: /work/xfc/vol1/user_cache/username The path is the path on the JASMIN system to the user area. Data can be copied here using standard UNIX command-line tools cp, mv, rsync. Subdirectories can be created using mkdir.

        content: "This article lists the JASMIN data transfer servers and provides links to how they can be used.\nPlease see further articles in the Data Transfer category for details on managing your data transfers.\nThe standard transfer servers provide a basic and functional service for moving small amounts of data over relatively short distances. However, the high-performance data transfer servers shown above are also available for those with particular requirements.\n\u0026nbsp; Please make sure you use the dedicated transfer servers and not the scientific analysis or login servers for any significant data transfers. The transfer servers have been configured to achieve the best transfer rates and will perform significantly better than other servers on jasmin, while maintaining the performance of analysis servers for interactive use by other users. JASMIN provides specific servers for managing data transfers. These are:\nxfer servers \u0026nbsp; Server Purpose Access requirements Further information xfer-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk Virtual machine for general purpose data transfers. jasmin-login Accessible from any network xfer-vm-02.jasmin.ac.uk Virtual machine for general purpose data transfers. jasmin-login Accessible from any network xfer-vm-03.jasmin.ac.uk Virtual machine for general purpose data transfers.\nHas cron for scheduled transfers, see notes. jasmin-login Accessible from any network. Notes:\nSimilar config on all 3 (no domain or reverse DNS restrictions now) Same advice applies re. SSH client version, see login nodes If using cron on xfer-vm-03, you must use crontamer Throttle any automated transfers to avoid many SSH connections in quick succession, otherwise you may get blocked. Consider using Globus for any data transfer in or out of JASMIN A new software collection jasmin-xfer has now been added to these servers, providing these tools: emacs-nox ftp lftp parallel python3-requests python3.11 python3.11-requests rclone rsync s3cmd screen xterm hpxfer servers \u0026nbsp; Server Purpose Access requirements Further information hpxfer3.jasmin.ac.uk Physical machine for higher-performance data transfers jasmin-login access role hpxfer4.jasmin.ac.uk Physical machine for higher-performance data transfers jasmin-login access role Notes:\nTested with sshftp (GridFTP over SSH) from ARCHER2 Same applies re. SSH client version, see login nodes The software collection jasmin-xfer available as per xfer servers, above The hpxfer role, and the supplying of client IP addresses is no longer required for these new servers. Avoid getting locked out with SSH transfers \u0026nbsp; Access rules in place to enable secure SSH connections from any network are sensitive to repeated, rapid connection attempts, which can result in being \u0026ldquo;locked out\u0026rdquo;. This may happen when attempting the transfer of several small files in quick succession with separate SSH connections for each. All the above servers behave the same way in this respect, so please be aware of this when managing your transfers.\n\u0026nbsp; Users are not permitted to execute commands which require administrative privileges. This applies to all hosts in the managed part of JASMIN where users have SSH login access (for example login, nx-login, sci, xfer and hpxfer machines). In other words, the use ofsu or sudo is not permitted. Please be careful when typing commands, particularly if you have multiple terminal windows open on your own computer, that you do not accidentally attempt sudoon a JASMIN machine: expect some follow-up from the JASMIN team if you do!

        content: "Choice of available Tools/Routes \u0026nbsp; See Data Transfer Tools for general information.\nUsers transferring data between ARCHER2 and JASMIN are often transferring relatively large sets of data, so it is important to choose the most appropriate route, method and tools to ensure you get the most efficient and reliable transfer experience. This can vary depending on system and network conditions.\nThe recommended option (as of mid-2024) is now Globus.\nCommon requirements to all of the methods are:\nan account with the jasmin-login\u0026nbsp; access role on JASMIN. a login account at ARCHER2 Please note:\nEnquiries about access to or use of ARCHER2 should be directed to ARCHER2 support ( support@archer2.ac.uk) Enquiries about access to or use of JASMIN should be directed to JASMIN support (use beacon, below-right or support@jasmin.ac.uk) Available transfer methods \u0026nbsp; Globus (recommended) Basic SSH transfer (slow but convenient) Gridftp using SSH authentication (efficient, currently still available but now superceded in convenience/reliability by Globus) 1st choice method: Globus \u0026nbsp; This is now the recommended method, because:\nit always ensures the best performance it is a managed transfer service, less prone to overloading and system issues it is actively maintained it is easy to use Because Globus can do transfers between two third-party locations, you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need to invoke the transfers from a machine on JASMIN, or ARCHER2 (even though it\u0026rsquo;s those two locations which will be involved as source and destination for the transfer). This could be done from your laptop or desktop, but could also be done from within a workflow that\u0026rsquo;s running somewhere (e.g. ARCHER2 or JASMIN). So, first think about where you want to control the process from.\nIn that location, follow the steps below:\n1. Set up the Globus Command Line interface\nfollow the steps described here 2. Identify the collections that you want to transfer between, for your transfer:\nIn this case, these are likely to be:\nthe ARCHER2 filesystems collection\u0026nbsp; , with ID 3e90d018-0d05-461a-bbaf-aab605283d21 the JASMIN default collection\u0026nbsp; , with ID a2f53b7f-1b4e-4dce-9b7c-349ae760fee0 Set an environment variable for each of these, to avoid having to type the ID each time: export a2c=3e90d018-0d05-461a-bbaf-aab605283d21 export jdc=a2f53b7f-1b4e-4dce-9b7c-349ae760fee0 3. Check access to these collections\nThese collections are restricted-access rather than public, so your access to them is via a series of authentication/authorisation/consent steps which the following actions will guide you through:\nglobus ls $a2c:/~/ (ARCHER2 home directory file listing should appear) globus ls $jdc:/~/ (JASMIN home directory file listing should appear) The steps above establish your ability to interact with each of the specified collections using Globus. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve completed each one, you should see a directory listing.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve completed the steps for both source and destination collections, you are ready to try a transfer.\n4. Initiate a simple transfer\nglobus transfer $a2c:/~/1M.dat $jdc:/~/1M.dat Message: The transfer has been accepted and a task has been created and queued for execution Task ID: aa0597a4-80a7-11ef-b36b-a1206a7ee65f This should complete quite quickly for a small file, but for a larger file you can check the progress using the task ID.\nglobus task show aa0597a4-80a7-11ef-b36b-a1206a7ee65f Label: None Task ID: aa0597a4-80a7-11ef-b36b-a1206a7ee65f Is Paused: False Type: TRANSFER Directories: 0 Files: 1 Status: SUCCEEDED Request Time: 2024-10-02T10:18:32+00:00 Faults: 0 Total Subtasks: 2 Subtasks Succeeded: 2 Subtasks Pending: 0 Subtasks Retrying: 0 Subtasks Failed: 0 Subtasks Canceled: 0 Subtasks Expired: 0 Subtasks with Skipped Errors: 0 Completion Time: 2024-10-02T10:18:39+00:00 Source Endpoint: Archer2 file systems Source Endpoint ID: 3e90d018-0d05-461a-bbaf-aab605283d21 Destination Endpoint: JASMIN Default Collection Destination Endpoint ID: a2f53b7f-1b4e-4dce-9b7c-349ae760fee0 Bytes Transferred: 1000000 Bytes Per Second: 148452 If you wanted to use the above in a script, and block/wait for the transfer task to complete before continuing, you can use globus task wait \u0026lt;taskid\u0026gt;, for example:\nglobus task wait aa0597a4-80a7-11ef-b36b-a1206a7ee65f will now return control immediately, since the task has completed.\nGlobus transfer tasks are asynchronous, submitted to your own mini-queue, where you can have as many queued tasks as you like but only 3 in progress at any one time. This ensures good performance for all users, but your tasks do not linger in long multi-user queues. The best way to reassure yourself of this is to try it out.\nFor help with any globus command you can do globus \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; --help.\nFurther examples including sync and automation are given in Globus command line interface, with further examples in the Globus documentation at https://\u0026nbsp; .\nRelevant examples:\nsync with wait\u0026nbsp; using the CLI. Repeatable transfer\u0026nbsp; using the PythonSDK (more advanced) Note that Globus transfers (and other actions) can be managed \u0026amp; monitored by:\na web interface the command-line interface, and a Python library all of which interact with the same underlying service.\nNCAS-CMS users should note that work is currently underway to adopt Globus as a drop-in replacement for certificate-based gridftp in Rose suites currently in use for automating processing and transferring to JASMIN.\n2nd choice method: Basic SSH transfer \u0026nbsp; scp/rsync/sftp: Simple transfers using easy method, pushing data to general purpose xfer nodes. Convenient, but limited performance.\nsource dest notes login.archer2.ac.uk xfer-vm-0[123].jasmin.ac.uk to virtual machine at JASMIN end login.archer2.ac.uk hpxfer[34].jasmin.ac.uk to high-performance physical machine at JASMIN end 3rd choice method: gridftp over SSH \u0026nbsp; GridFTP over SSH: GridFTP performance with convenience of SSH. Requires persistent ssh agent on local machine where you have your JASMIN key.\nsource dest login.archer2.ac.uk hpxfer[34].jasmin.ac.uk The next-best method for transfers between ARCHER2 and JASMIN is using the globus-url-copy client tool with SSH authentication, as described below: (This is not Globus, however, despite the tool name!)\n1. Load your SSH keys for both JASMIN and ARCHER2 on your local machine, then log in to ARCHER2.\nYou will need to have loaded into your SSH agent:\nThe SSH key associated with your JASMIN account The SSH key associated with your ARCHER2 account, if you have one (it is recommended to use a different one than for JASMIN, if so) You also need to ensure that you connect with the -A option for agent forwarding, to enable the JASMIN key to be available for the onward authentication with the JASMIN server.\nNote that you do not (and should not) copy your JASMIN private key to ARCHER2. It should stay on your local machine. This does mean that you need an ssh- agent running on your local machine, so this method may not work for long- running continuous processes that need to spawn transfers.\nssh-add \u0026lt;jasmin ssh key\u0026gt; (path to your JASMIN ssh key file on your local machine) ssh-add \u0026lt;archer2 ssh key\u0026gt; (path to your ARCHER2 ssh key if you have one, on on your local machine) ssh-add -l check both keys are loaded (are both key signatures listed in the output?) ssh -A \u0026lt;archer2-username\u0026gt;@login.archer2.ac.uk #(ARCHER2 now uses multi-factor auth at this stage) 2. Load the gct module (to make the current globus-url-copy command available in the path)\nmodule load gct which globus-url-copy /work/y07/shared/gct/v6.2.20201212/bin/globus-url-copy 3. Transfer a single file to your home directory on JASMIN (limited space, but to check things work)\nglobus-url-copy -vb \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; sshftp://\u0026lt;jasmin-username\u0026gt;@hpxfer3.jasmin.ac.uk/~/\u0026lt;file\u0026gt; Obviously, replace \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; with the path to the file you want to transfer.\n4. Recursively transfer a directory of files, using the concurrency option for multiple parallel transfers\nglobus-url-copy -vb -cd -r -cc 4 SRC/DATA/ sshftp://\u0026lt;jasmin-username\u0026gt;@hpxfer3.jasmin.ac.uk/DEST/DATA/ NOTE: - The -cc option initiates the parallel transfer of several files at a time, which achieves good overall transfer rates for recursive directory transfers. This is different from using the -p N -fast options which use parallel network streams to parallelism the transfer of each file. A sensible value for -cc is 2 or 4, whereas a sensible value for -p is between 2 and 16. In both cases, try first and avoid numbers at the higher end, which can increase resource usage without further performance gains.\nHere, the options used are (see man globus-url-copy for full details):\n-vb | -verbose-perf During the transfer, display the number of bytes transferred and the transfer rate per second. Show urls being transferred -concurrency | -cc Number of concurrent ftp connections to use for multiple transfers. -cd | -create-dest Create destination directory if needed -r | -recurse Copy files in subdirectories5. Use the sync option to synchronise 2 directories between source and target file systems:\nglobus-url-copy -vb -cd -r -cc 4 -sync SRC/DATA/ sshftp://\u0026lt;jasmin-username\u0026gt;@hpxfer3.jasmin.ac.uk/DEST/DATA/ where SRC/DATA/ and /DEST/DATA/ are source and destination paths, respectively (include trailing slash).\nOptions are as before but with:\n-sync Only transfer files where the destination does not exist or differs from the source. -sync-level controls how to determine if files differNote that the default sync level is 2, see level descriptions below, which only compares time stamps. If you want to include a file integrity check using checksums, you need to use-sync-level 3 but there may be a performance cost.\n-sync-level Choose criteria for determining if files differ when performing a sync transfer. Level 0 will only transfer if the destination does not exist. Level 1 will transfer if the size of the destination does not match the size of the source. Level 2 will transfer if the timestamp of the destination is older than the timestamp of the source, or the sizes do not match. Level 3 will perform a checksum of the source and destination and transfer if the checksums do not match, or the sizes do not match. The default sync level is 2.So a full sync including comparison of checksums would be:\nglobus-url-copy -vb -cd -r -cc 4 -sync -sync-level 3 SRC/DATA/ sshftp://\u0026lt;jasmin-username\u0026gt;@hpxfer3.jasmin.ac.uk/DEST/DATA/"

        content: "\u0026nbsp; This article was originally written in 2018/19 to introduce new forms of storage which were brought into production at that stage. Some of the information and terminology is now out of date, pending further review of JASMIN documentation. Introduction \u0026nbsp; JASMIN continues to grow as a unique collaborative analysis environment for an expanding community of scientists. Some of the big challenges we attempted to address with Phase 4 were the ever-growing demand for storage space and the increasing diversity of scientific workflows. However, we’re aware that some aspects of the changes introduced in Phase 4 have presented some challenges in themselves. Here, we outline the reasons for the changes and try to summarise some of the challenges and what can be done to help deal with them.\nBackground \u0026nbsp; (skip this if you just want to go straight to the advice):\nWith phase 4 we knew we had to both replace existing storage that had become uneconomic to maintain, and add significantly more volume! However, we also knew that most of the data stored on JASMIN disk is not touched for months on end, but that some data is heavily used. We also knew that the traditional way of building disk systems was no longer suitable for the scales (volumes of data) we needed to handle, being supplanted by new technologies, and that at some point our community would have to get used to these new technologies too. The solution we chose for JASMIN is the same solution being deployed at most large HPC sites: deploying tiered storage, that is more types of storage, and requiring you, the user, to use the right kind of storage in the right place in your workflow!\nUnderstanding the four types of JASMIN disk: \u0026nbsp; We have settled on four kinds of disk storage - quite an increase from the one we had previously! Each is best for one kind of workflow, although each “can do” most things, although not always well. We will see below that there is one kind of activity that we now need to be much more careful about, because doing it not only causes problems for individuals, but also for everyone else. We could stop allowing this to happen, but it would be at a performance penalty which would occur all the time: we have gone for “better with occasional really slow” in preference to “always predictably slow” performance. What we need you to do is learn how to avoid creating the “occasionally really slow” times!\nThe four types are:\nSolid state fast but not parallel disk (SSD), really suitable for small files. This is what is used for your /home/users directories, so is good for things you really don’t want to lose, because this area is backed up. The same type of storage is also used for the scratch area /work/scratch-nopw, although this is NOT for persistent storage and is NOT backed up. SSD is great for compiling and storing millions of small files, but is the most expensive storage, so we don’t have a lot of it. Fast parallel disk (PFS) , great for jobs that read and write the same file from many different processes. This is what we had before. It’s not so great for lots of small files. This is still pretty expensive, which is one of the reasons why we haven’t simply stayed with it. Some GWS still use this, but most are migrating to the next category - scale-out file storage. Scale Out File Storage (SOF). This is what most of our Group Workspaces (GWS) will use. This is great for large volumes of data with regular use (consider near-line tape storage if you don’t need access for a significant period). SOF is not so great for small files, so if you have lots of small files, best to either aggregate them or tar them up. This is terrible for parallel write access to files, and you must avoid that. More details on that below, but the key point is you might find you need to use the fast parallel scratch (currently /work/scratch) in your workflows as an intermediary between persisting your data and your Lotus batch jobs. High Performance Object Storage (HPOS). This is a new type of storage, and it’s best if you are working with the cloud. It’s going to be a bit tricky to get the hang of, so pay attention to the various things we’re going to be saying over the next few months about how to use it. It is the future though\u0026hellip; What type of storage am I using? \u0026nbsp; Storage Type Parallel-write Good for small files? Backed up? /home/users SSD no yes e.g. Installing Conda yes /gws/pw/j07/* PFS yes no no /gws/nopw/j04/* SOF no no no /gws/smf/j04/* SSD no yes yes /work/scratch-pw[23] PFS yes no no /work/scratch-nopw2 SSD no yes no /work/xfc/volX SOF no no no Automounted SOF storage: GWS storage volumes /gws/nopw/j04/* are automounted. This means that a particular GWS volume is not mounted by a particular host until the moment it is first accessed. If the volume you are expecting to see is not listed at the top level ( /gws/nopw/j04/) you should use the full path of the volume to access it, and after a very short delay, the volume should appear.\nSee also here to see where these are mounted throughout JASMIN.\nThe BIG issue: why you need to be careful about parallel file access \u0026nbsp; (even if you don’t think you are doing it):\nTraditional disk systems try and do cunning things when different processes are writing to the same file; they can lock the file so only one process can have a turn at a time, or they can try and stack up the updates and do them one after another (and hope they don’t interfere), but at scale, all those tricks come with a performance cost. That cost gets paid in many ways: raw I/O speed, how many extra copies of blocks get written, how long it takes to rebuild if things go wrong, how big any part of the storage can be… and, how much kit and software the vendors need to deliver to make it work. All that cost is worth it if your workflow needs it (and can’t avoid it), but in the JASMIN environment, not many workflows actually need it.\nOur fast parallel disk is fine for those workflows, but none of the others support it well, and in particular for our scale-out file storage, as used by most GWSs, the way it works means that if we turn on the support for parallel write, it will become much slower and write many more copies of some data blocks, meaning it will do I/O slower, and it will store less! Not what we want. The parallel read is fine! However, avoiding parallel writes has turned out to be harder than we anticipated, your workflows have many more ways of doing it than we thought! Sadly, when you do parallel writes, the file system can get “stuck” and that’s when everything goes really slow, for everyone on that host …\nOne way around this is for us to apply “global write locking” to a GWS volume (your GWS manager would need to request this). This solves the problem by preventing parallel writes altogether, but at a significant cost in performance.\nFAQs, issues and solutions \u0026nbsp; Please read our collection of FAQs and known issues (and solutions!) which we\u0026rsquo;ve put together HERE."

        description: "Using Cron",
        
        
        content: "Cron is a very common job scheduler for linux. It allows users to run the same command or shell script periodically. Typically it is used to automate tasks, for example, every Monday run my script to plot last week\u0026rsquo;s data. There are many guides to using cron and crontab\u0026nbsp; (the command for loading the cron job table).\nCron on JASMIN \u0026nbsp; Generally cron is disabled on the JASMIN general access machines such as sci-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk. This is to avoid people killing the machine by setting up lots of processing jobs when better alternatives, e.g. Lotus, are available. However, there are times when it is appropriate to use cron and so a generic cron service machine is provided. cron-01.jasmin.ac.uk is configured like sci*.jasmin.ac.uk, except cron is enabled. Anyone who can log into sci* should also be able to login to cron-01.jasmin.ac.uk.\nAn additional transfer server xfer-vm-03.jasmin.ac.uk is equipped with cron for scheduling transfers only (no processing), although other methods for scheduling/automating transfers are available. See also transfer servers.\nThere are a few rules of the road to using this service:\nAvoid process pile up : If a job has not finished before the cron starts the next instance of the same job then competition for resources probably means that job will also not finish. Eventually a mass of unfinished jobs will overwhelm the whole machine and it will crash. To avoid this jobs should test to see if the previous job is still running by using a lock file, or making sure the jobs timeout. The crontamer wrapper script, documented below, is available to help you implement this. Expect it to break occasionally : Regardless of any measure introduced by users to stop process pile up, you can expect it to go rouge at some point. We will reboot the machine when this happens, probably without warning. We may remove offending jobs from the cron table but persistent offenders may be barred from using the service. Don\u0026rsquo;t do heavy processing or data transfers on cron-01. You can submit jobs to lotus to offload the processing resource: Slurm submission tools like sbatch are installed on cron-01.jasmin.ac.uk. Use xfer-vm-03 for cron-based transfers (not cron-01). Common Cron Gotchas \u0026nbsp; The bash shell environment when cron launches scripts is not identical to the one when working interactively. Annoyingly, the path to common tools, like sbatch, may not have been setup so that you get an error message from cron when it works perfectly well interactively. A way to get round this is to source the .bash_profile in the crontab file so that the interactive environment is used by cron.\n24 * * * * . $HOME/.bash_profile; sbatch -W 12:0 mycmd.sh Crontamer \u0026nbsp; Crontamer is a wrapper script to implement lock file and time out checking for cron jobs to avoid issues of \u0026ldquo;runaway\u0026rdquo; jobs causing problems for everyone (e.g. where new jobs start before old ones finish, which can cause a snowball effect).\nYou can download the crontamer script from https://github.com/cedadev/crontamer\u0026nbsp; . It is already installed on cron-01 and xfer-vm-03.\nUse cron as normal, but include the crontamer command before the users own script and arguments.\ncrontab -l ## e.g. cron file entry to run job every day at 4am: 0 4 * * * crontamer -t 2h \u0026#39;/home/users/jblogs/bin/my_repeat_script.sh -opt1 arg1 arg2\u0026#39; Note: crontamer has a number of options which can be conflated with the options for the wrapped script. Use single quotes to make sure the script runs with the right options.\nThe flow of the crontamer script is like this:\nCheck for existing lock file to indicate if the script is already running. If the lockfile is there and it can see the matching process still running then it exits silently. If the lock file is not there or it can\u0026rsquo;t see the matching process on the system then it starts the wrapped script. Periodically check the wrapped script is running. If the script fails, with a non-zero exit return code, then it can email you. If the script has been running longer than specified timeout (default 12hr) then it will be killed. Unless a named lock file is given the lock files are created in the /tmp directory as\n/tmp/crontamer.unique_idThese files should be cleaned up automatically, but users may need occasional checks or find them helpful for identifying problems running their scripts. The unique_id is based on a combination of the username, passed script and arguments, enabling multiple calls of a script with different arguments to be handled separately.\nAll the principles above apply whether using cron on:\nthe cron server cron-01.jasmin.ac.uk (for initiating processing workflows) the transfer server xfer-vm-03.jasmin.ac.uk (for initiating automated transfers)"

        content: "This article provides a basic example of using Matplotlib on JASMIN to generate a plot. It also gives an important tip that may stop your code failing when run on the LOTUS cluster.\nMatplotlib - a basic example \u0026nbsp; Matplotlib\u0026nbsp; is a very well documented plotting library for Python. Here is a brief example of generating a line graph on a PNG file using matplotlib.\nLoad the Jaspy Python 3 environment, and start a Python session:\nmodule load jaspy python In python, set some x-values, y-values, axis labels and a title, and plot:\nimport matplotlib matplotlib.use(\u0026#39;agg\u0026#39;) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x_values = [1, 5, 3, 9, 14] y_values = [2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020] x_label = \u0026#39;Temperature (degC)\u0026#39; y_label = \u0026#39;Year\u0026#39; title = \u0026#39;Average temperature of garden shed (2000-2020)\u0026#39; plt.plot(y_values, x_values, \u0026#39;g--\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(y_label) plt.xlabel(x_label) plt.title(title) plt.savefig(\u0026#39;output.png\u0026#39;) Plotting with matplotlib on LOTUS \u0026nbsp; When using matplotlib on LOTUS hosts please make sure that you are setting the rendering backend to a setting that will definitely work. This must be done before importing matplotlib.pyplot.\nOn JASMIN it is safe to use:\nimport matplotlib matplotlib.use(\u0026#39;agg\u0026#39;) import matplotlib.pyplot as pltor alternatively, the MPLBACKEND environment variable can be set in the job script before invoking python:\nexport MPLBACKEND=aggIf you do not set this option or you choose an alternative backend then you may see failures which include very large dump (error) files being written (up to 56GB per file!). Please remove these files if you accidentally create them, and switch over to selecting an appropriate rendering backend as indicated above.\nNote that if you see the following error message, this results from attempting to use the default GTK backend on LOTUS (as GTK is only available in an interactive X-windows environment). The solution is to use agg, as described above.\nValueError: Namespace Gtk not available for version 3.0 For more information please see the matplotlib back-ends page\u0026nbsp; ."

        title: "Using the JASMIN Object Store",
        description: "Using the JASMIN Object Store",
        
        
        content: "This article describes how to use the JASMIN high-performance object storage.\nWhat is object storage? \u0026nbsp; An object store\u0026nbsp; is a data storage system that manages data as objects referenced by a globally unique identifier, with attached metadata. This is a fundamental change from traditional file systems that you may be used to, as there is no directory hierarchy - the objects exist in a single flat domain. These semantics allow the object store to scale out much more easily than a traditional shared file system.\nThe other fundamental change is that the data is no longer accessed by mounting a file system onto a host and referencing a file path (where authentication is \u0026ldquo;can I log in to the host\u0026rdquo;). Instead, the data is accessed over HTTP, with authentication using HTTP headers. This has many benefits, the biggest of which is that we can make the object store available outside of the JASMIN firewall, for example to the JASMIN External Cloud. Data can be read and written in the same way, using the same tools, from inside and outside JASMIN. Contrast this with Group Workspaces, where you must be logged in to a JASMIN host in order to write data using the file system, and data is only accessible externally in a readonly way using HTTP or OPeNDAP or via data transfer methods.\nObject stores are seen as the most efficient (and cheapest!) way to store and access data from the cloud, and all the major cloud providers support some variant of object store. The JASMIN object store is S3 compatible\u0026nbsp; - S3 is the object store for Amazon Web Services (AWS), and has become a de- facto standard interface for object stores. This means that all the same tools that work with AWS S3 will also work with the JASMIN object store.\nAccessing the object store \u0026nbsp; The JASMIN object store is organised into tenancies. These are shared areas of the object store, similar in concept to Group Workspaces, and are requested by users, usually Group Workspace Managers. Several users can have access to a tenancy, and so they can be used collaboratively.\nTo join an existing object store tenancy, navigate to the \u0026ldquo;Services\u0026rdquo; section in the JASMIN Accounts Portal and select the \u0026ldquo;Object store\u0026rdquo; category. Select a tenancy and submit a request to join. This request will then be considered by the manager of the tenancy and either accepted or rejected.\nFor details on how to request and manage an object store tenancy, please see the help article \u0026ldquo;JASMIN Object Store for Managers\u0026rdquo; (forthcoming).\nDefault access policies \u0026nbsp; As of Jan 2024, we have changed the default access policy for newly created tenancies to provide a more sensible and flexible set of access policies.\nThe old policy allowed any members of the tenancy access to any bucket created in the tenancy by default. The new policy allow Users (USER only in the JASMIN Accounts Portal) of the tenancy only access to buckets they own by default. This can be effectively changed to the old policy by setting the policy of the bucket to the LDAP group for the tenancy members (-members, e.g. cedadev-o-members) - this can be done using the JASMIN Object Store portal (below) or the Swarm portal. Specific JASMIN users or groups can also be given permission to buckets (group access is controlled by LDAP groups, and only existing LDAP group will work - you may need to ask for one to be created).\nThe new policy also gives admin access for tenancy MANAGER and DEPUTY roles, who have access to all the buckets in the tenancy.\nCreating an access key and secret \u0026nbsp; Authentication with the object store uses an access key and secret that are separate to your JASMIN username and password. You can generate keys and manage bucket permissions through the JASMIN Object Store Portal.\u0026nbsp; JASMIN sbject store portal You can log in with your JASMIN username and password. You can then click on the \u0026ldquo;Object Stores\u0026rdquo; button on the right. This will present you with the list of object store tenancies that you have access to. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see an object store tenancy that you expect to, please check you have access in the JASMIN Accounts Portal\u0026nbsp; . If you have access in the Accounts Portal, but not in the Object Store Portal then please email the helpdesk.\nList of object store tenancies The URL for the object store tenancy is also presented here for convenience. You can click on the \u0026ldquo;Manage Object Store\u0026rdquo; button to manage you keys and buckets. This will ask you to confirm your JASMIN password.\nPrompt for password You will then be presented with the following page.\nexisting keys From this page you can view your existing keys, and delete them if you require. You can also use the \u0026ldquo;Create Key\u0026rdquo; tab on the left.\nCreate access key You need to name the key and enter an expiry date for it. This will then present you with a pop-up with details on your access key and secret key. This is the only time your secret key will visible, so save it immediately in a secure password manager.\nManaging bucket permissions \u0026nbsp; You can also manage the permissions on buckets using the \u0026ldquo;Buckets\u0026rdquo; tab from this page. This allows you to manage the access policies for your buckets without using the S3 API or the Swarm portal.\nBucket permissions Click on the \u0026ldquo;Manage permissions\u0026rdquo; button for a bucket to add or change access policies for that bucket.\nGranting access By default this lets you grant access to specific JASMIN Users and/or groups (these are LDAP groups and you might need to request that one is created for you if you require a subgroup for your tenancy). The advanced tab gives you the same options as available through the Swarm portal - including making buckets publicly accessible. Once done, hit the save to add the policy to the bucket. You can edit or delete permissions from that bucket through the \u0026ldquo;View Bucket Policies\u0026rdquo; tab.\nLegacy method for key creation \u0026nbsp; This is the old way of creating keys which still works, but the new way above is accessible outside JASMIN on the public internet.\nYou can generate an access key and secret using the Caringo portal.\nAuthentication with the object store uses an access key and secret that are separate to your JASMIN username and password. You can generate an access key and secret using the Caringo portal. This portal is not currently available outside of JASMIN - you will need to use a graphical session on JASMIN to access a Firefox browser running on a JASMIN system.\nThe recommended way to do this is using the NX Graphical Desktop service. You can start Firefox from the \u0026ldquo;Activities\u0026rdquo; menu once you have logged in to your graphical desktop on one of the nx-login* servers (so no need to make an onward connection to a sci server).\nAn alternative option is to using X11 Forwarding on your SSH connection. You need to do this on one of the nx* servers (not the sci servers as previously) because this is where firefox is now installed:\nssh -X \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;@nx1.jasmin.ac.uk firefox(try -Y if -X does not work for you).\nOnce you have Firefox open, navigate to\nhttp://my-os-tenancy-o.s3.jc.rl.ac.uk:81/_admin/portalbut replace my-os-tenancy-o with your tenancy name.\nYou will see a login screen where you should enter your JASMIN username and password:\nIf you receive a \u0026ldquo;HTTP ERROR 500 java\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; error, it is likely that you haven\u0026rsquo;t added the port (81) to the address.\nUpon successfully entering the username and password of a user who belongs to the tenancy, you will see a dashboard. To create an access key and secret, click on the cog icon and select \u0026ldquo;Tokens\u0026rdquo;:\nOn the tokens page, click \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo;:\nIn the dialogue that pops up, enter a description for the token and set an expiration date. Make sure to click \u0026ldquo;S3 Secret Key\u0026rdquo; - this will expose an additional field containing the secret key. Make sure you copy this and store it somewhere safe - you will not be able to see it again! This value will be used whenever the \u0026ldquo;S3 secret key\u0026rdquo; is required.\nOnce the token is created, it will appear in the list. The \u0026ldquo;Token\u0026rdquo; should be used whenever the \u0026ldquo;S3 access key\u0026rdquo; is required:\nAccessing data in the object store \u0026nbsp; URLs for internal and external access \u0026nbsp; Although the data is exactly the same in both cases, a slightly different URL must be used depending on whether you are accessing the object store from the JASMIN managed cloud servers or from the JASMIN External Cloud.\nFrom inside JASMIN, including LOTUS and the Scientific Analysis servers, my-os-tenancy-o.s3.jc.rl.ac.uk should be used, with the `http://`` prefix.\nFrom the JASMIN External Cloud, and from locations external to JASMIN, my-os-tenancy-o.s3-ext.jc.rl.ac.uk should be used - note the https:// prefix and additional -ext.\n(Where my-os-tenancy-o needs to be replaced with your tenancy name)\nUsing s3cmd \u0026nbsp; s3cmd is a command line tool provided by Amazon to work with S3 compatible Object Storage. It is installed on JASMIN, both on the sci-machines and on LOTUS. It is a little more complicated to use than the MinIO client, but is more powerful and flexible. For full details on s3cmd, see the s3tools.org website\u0026nbsp; .\nTo configure s3cmd to use the JASMIN object store, you need to create and edit a ~/.s3cfg file. To access the my-os-tenancy-o tenancy (where \u0026ldquo;my-os- tenancy-o\u0026rdquo; needs to be replaced with your tenancy name), the following should be in the ~/.s3cfg file:\naccess_key = \u0026lt;access key generated above\u0026gt; host_base = my-os-tenancy-o.s3.jc.rl.ac.uk host_bucket = my-os-tenancy-o.s3.jc.rl.ac.uk secret_key = \u0026lt;secret key generated above\u0026gt; use_https = False signature_v2 = Falseor, from an external tenancy or locations outside of JASMIN:\naccess_key = \u0026lt;access key generated above\u0026gt; host_base = my-os-tenancy-o.s3-ext.jc.rl.ac.uk host_bucket = my-os-tenancy-o.s3-ext.jc.rl.ac.uk secret_key = \u0026lt;secret key generated above\u0026gt; use_https = True signature_v2 = FalseTo see which commands can be used with s3cmd, type:\ns3cmd -hTo list a tenancy\u0026rsquo;s buckets:\ns3cmd lsTo list the contents of a bucket:\ns3cmd ls s3://\u0026lt;bucket_name\u0026gt;Make a new bucket:\ns3cmd mb s3://\u0026lt;bucket_name\u0026gt;s3cmd uses PUT and GET nomenclature for copying files to and from the object store.\nTo copy a file to a bucket in the object store:\ns3cmd put \u0026lt;file name\u0026gt; s3://\u0026lt;bucket_name\u0026gt;To copy a file from a bucket in the object store to the file system:\ns3cmd get s3://\u0026lt;bucket_name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;object_name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file_name\u0026gt;For more commands and ways of using s3cmd, see the s3tools website\u0026nbsp; .\nUsing the MinIO client \u0026nbsp; The MinIO Client is a command line tool to connect to object stores (among other types of file storage) and interface with it as you would with a UNIX filesystem. As such, many of the UNIX file management commands found in standard installations of the OS are found within this client ( ls, cat, cp, rm for example).\nThere are a number of ways to install this client as shown in the quickstart guide\u0026nbsp; . Methods include: docker, Homebrew for macOS, wget for Linux and instructions for Windows. Follow these steps to get the client installed on the relevant system.\nMinIO Client is not installed on JASMIN, but users can download and install it to their own user space, following the instructions for \u0026ldquo;64-bit Intel\u0026rdquo; (linux- amd64) in the MinIO quickstart guide. Below is an example to install it into the bin directory in your user space\nmkdir ~/bin wget https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc ~/bin chmod u+x ~/bin/mcYou can then add the ~/bin directory to the PATH environment variable in your ~/.bashrc file to allow mc to be accessed from anywhere on JASMIN.\n# User specific aliases and functions PATH=$PATH:$HOME/binTo configure the client with the JASMIN object store, create an access key and secret as documented above and insert them into the command:\nmc config host add [ALIAS] [S3-ENDPOINT] [TOKEN] [S3 SECRET KEY]The ALIAS is the name you\u0026rsquo;ll reference the object store when using the client. To demonstrate, if the alias was set to \u0026ldquo;jasmin-store\u0026rdquo;, displaying a specific bucket in the object store would be done in the following way:\nmc ls jasmin-store/my-bucketThe commands available in the client are documented in the quickstart guide (linked above). Copying an object from one place to another is very similar to a UNIX filesystem:\nmc cp jasmin-store/my-bucket/object-1 jasmin-store/different-bucket/ From Python \u0026nbsp; One method of accessing the object store from Python is using s3fs\u0026nbsp; . This library builds on botocore\u0026nbsp; but abstracts a lot of the complexities away. There are three main types of object in this library: S3FileSystem\u0026nbsp; , S3File\u0026nbsp; and S3Map\u0026nbsp; . The filesystem object is used to configure a connection to the object store. Note: it\u0026rsquo;s strongly recommended to store the endpoint, token and secret outside of the Python file, either using environment variables or an external file. This object can be used for lots of the operations which can be done MinIO:\nimport json import s3fs with open(\u0026#39;jasmin_object_store_credentials.json\u0026#39;) as f: jasmin_store_credentials = json.load(f) jasmin_s3 = s3fs.S3FileSystem( anon=False, secret=jasmin_store_credentials[\u0026#39;secret\u0026#39;], key=jasmin_store_credentials[\u0026#39;token\u0026#39;], client_kwargs=\u0026#39;endpoint_url\u0026#39;: jasmin_store_credentials[\u0026#39;endpoint_url\u0026#39;] ) # list the objects in a bucket my_objects = jasmin_s3.ls(\u0026#39;my-bucket\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#39;My objects: \u0026#39;.format(my_objects)) # report the size of an object my_object_size = jasmin_s3.du(\u0026#39;my-bucket/object-1\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#39;Size: \u0026#39;.format(my_object_size))Please note in the example above, the jasmin_object_store_credentials.json file would look along the lines of:\n \u0026#34;token\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;access key generated above\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;secret\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;secret key generated above\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;endpoint_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://my-os-tenancy-o.s3.jc.rl.ac.uk\u0026#34; or, from an external tenancy or locations outside of JASMIN:\n \u0026#34;token\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;access key generated above\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;secret\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;secret key generated above\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;endpoint_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://my-os-tenancy-o.s3-ext.jc.rl.ac.uk\u0026#34; S3File is used for dealing with individual files on the object store within Python. These objects can read and written to and from the store:\nfile_object = s3fs.S3File(jasmin_s3, \u0026#39;my-bucket/object-1\u0026#39;, mode=\u0026#39;rb\u0026#39;) # refresh can be set to True to disable metadata caching file_metadata = file_object.metadata(refresh=False) # Writing data to variable in Python file_object.write(data) # Data will only be written to the object store if flush() is used. This can be executed in S3FS source code if the buffer \u0026gt;= the blocksize file_object.flush()S3Map is very useful when using xarray\u0026nbsp; to open a number of data files (netCDF4 for example), and turn them into the zarr format ready to be stored as objects on the store. The function for this can store a .zarr file in a POSIX filesystem, or can be streamed directly to an object store. These datasets can then be opened back into Python:\nxarray.open_mfdataset(filepath_list, engine=netcdf4) s3_store = s3fs.S3Map(\u0026#39;my-bucket/zarr-data\u0026#39;, s3=jasmin_s3) dataset.to_zarr(store=s3_store, mode=\u0026#39;w\u0026#39;) # Reopening the dataset from object store using xarray xarray.open_zarr(s3_store, consolidated=True) Using rclone \u0026nbsp; Rclone can be configured to perform operations on an S3 object store backend, just as it can for a long list of other backend storage types. It is mentioned in our data transfer section here, but extensively documented here.\nBelow is an example of how to copy data to the JASMIN object store using rclone, in a very similar manner to how you would use rsync. However, first you need to define parameters for accessing the JASMIN object store.\nDo this by using the rclone config wizard. This will update the configuration file (~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf) so that it looks like this:\n[cedadev-o] type = s3 provider = Other access_key_id = \u0026lt;access key as above\u0026gt; secret_access_key = \u0026lt;secret key as above\u0026gt; endpoint = cedadev-o.s3-ext.jc.rl.ac.uk acl = privateYou could then copy the contents of a directory to this remote, using the rclone copy command ( full description here\u0026nbsp; ):\nrclone copy source:sourcepath dest:destpath This will copy the contents of sourcepath to destpath, but not the directories themselves. By default, it does not transfer files that are identical on source and destination, testing by modification time or md5sum. It will not delete files from the destination (but note that the rclone sync command will). For copying single files, use the rclone copyto command.\nThe example above copies from a local sourcepath, which could be a directory on your local machine (either your local laptop/desktop, or perhaps a JASMIN xfer server).

        content: "Introduction \u0026nbsp; This article describes the way that storage is usually provided to projects on JASMIN: the Group Workspace (GWS).\nWhat is a GWS? \u0026nbsp; GWSs are portions of disk allocated for particular projects to manage themselves, enabling collaborating scientists to share network accessible storage on JASMIN. Users can pull data from external sites to a common cache, process and analyse their data, and where allowed, exploit data available from other GWSs and from the CEDA archive.\nIt is important to understand that these workspaces are not the same as the CEDA archive. Data in a GWS can be earmarked for ingestion into the CEDA archive, but this process should be discussed directly with the CEDA Archive team (via the CEDA Helpdesk), it is not automatic and will not happen without prior arrangement.\nData within GWSs are the responsibility of the designated GWS manager and are not backed up by the JASMIN team (see below).\nAccessing a GWS \u0026nbsp; Where are GWSs available? \u0026nbsp; Each GWS volume is found in a directory mounted under a pattern of paths which refers to the capabilities of the storage, ie.\nPath Type Capability /gws/nopw/j04/* SOF no parallel write (nopw) /gws/pw/j07/* PFS parallel write capable (pw) /gws/smf/j04/* SSD small-files optimised (smf) A project may have several GWS volumes, perhaps of different types, for example:\n/gws/nopw/j04/jules SOF volume for the jules project GWSs are available on:\nTransfer servers including xfer*, hpxfer*, gridftp* and the JASMIN Default Collection Globus endpoint. The general scientific analysis servers sci* All nodes in the LOTUS and ORCHID clusters Some application-specific servers (by arrangement) They are NOT available on login or nx servers.\nRequesting access to a GWS \u0026nbsp; There is a Unix group associated with each GWS to provide convenient access control. Any JASMIN user can apply for access to a given GWS by following the links provided in the list of available GWSs\u0026nbsp; on the JASMIN Accounts Portal. Important: The GWS Manager (not the JASMIN team) will need to authorise the request before you are granted access.\nOnce you have been granted the relevant access role, then the relevant Unix group will be added to your account. If you are not sure of the group name for your GWS you can find this by entering the command groups to see the names of the groups you belong to. The group name normally has the prefix “gws_\u0026quot;.\n\u0026nbsp; All data in a GWS should belong to this group gws_\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;, so that group read/write permissions apply to this group rather than the default group, users. GWS management \u0026nbsp; Each GWS has a designated manager. See the article on managing a GWS.\nBackup \u0026nbsp; Please note that data in GWSs are only backed up if the GWS Manager has put tasks in place to do this. The Elastic Tape service is available to enable to make a secondary near-line copy of data. Please discuss the details with your GWS Manager.\nRecommended directory structure for a GWS \u0026nbsp; We recommend that a sensible directory structure is set up within your GWS in order to conventions are used within your GWS:\n\u0026lt;your_gws\u0026gt;/ users/ \u0026lt;userid\u0026gt;/ # each user can create their own directory here public/ # required if you want to share data via HTTP data/ internal/ # internal/intermediate data incoming/ # third-party data brought to the GWS output/ # output data generated by projectSee the GWS etiquette article for more details about GWSs and the GWS data sharing via HTTP article for information about the use of the public directory."

        content: "The number-of-groups limitation - and how to work around it\nDescription \u0026nbsp; On JASMIN, users are added to Linux groups for access to the group workspaces and CEDA datasets which they have registered to use, in addition to a couple of standard groups granted for all users.\nType the id command to see which groups you are a member of. The first one (shown with gid=) is your primary group, and the list starting groups= contains your supplementary groups.\nAlthough the Linux operating system allows the group list to contain a large number of supplementary groups, certain types of filesystem are subject to a maximum number that is supported. When such filesystems are accessed, a truncated copy of the group list may be used while deciding whether to grant read or write access to a given file or directory. This can mean that although a user is a member of the group which is needed, a permissions error still occurs, because the relevant group is being ignored. The groups which are ignored are those with the higher numerical group IDs.\nThe most significant limitation affecting JASMIN users is for filesystems which are mounted as type NFS, because this only supports 16 groups. In particular, this applies to the group workspaces that are optimised for small files (under path /gws/smf). It also applies to the home directories and /apps software directories, and although with these directories it is not normally necessary to restrict access via Linux groups, the restriction can affect for example access to the NAG library licence file for NERC users. The panfs filesystem type (Panasas group workspaces under /group_workspaces) is also affected in principle, but it has a limit of 32 groups, which is less likely to affect users.\nWorkarounds \u0026nbsp; newgrp \u0026nbsp; The newgrp program is available on all machines, and can be used to choose a particular group. For example, typing:\nnewgrp ukmo_climwill start a session (sub-shell) in which the primary group ID of the process is ukmo_clim (provided that you are already a member of that group). This will ensure that, in that session, you have access to any files which require that group. Note that it will also mean that any files and directories you create in that session will be owned by the group which you selected (although they can subsequently be changed with the chgrp command). When you exit from the sub-shell, you will be returned to the original session with your normal group list.\nThe main limitations of newgrp are that:\nIt only works interactively, so it is not possible to use it in LOTUS jobs. It only affects the primary group ID, so cannot be used to guarantee access to more than one group simultaneously, because some groups on the supplementary group list might still be ignored for filesystem accesses. Note that if newgrp prompts for a password, it is because you are trying to use it to access a group that you are not a member of (and then there is no password that you can usefully type).\nwithgroups \u0026nbsp; On the JASMIN scientific analysis machines running CentOS7, including the LOTUS nodes in the centos7 queue, a utility (written locally by CEDA) has been added, which overcomes the above mentioned limitations of the newgrp program. It is not available on the machines running RHEL6.\nTo use withgroups, you first need the following command (in your interactive session or shell script):\nmodule load jasmin-sciOnce you have done this, you can run any individual command with the syntax withgroups \u0026lt;group\u0026gt; \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; followed by any commands arguments, for example:\nwithgroups ukmo_clim ls /badc/ukmo-mslp/You can also use a comma-separated list of groups if a command requires more than one group, for example if you wanted to copy a file between group workspaces:\nwithgroups gws_foo,gws_bar cp /gws/smf/foo/myfile /gws/smf/bar/In these cases, the group list consists only of the specified groups. So if you specify a few additional groups, these should be safe from being ignored during filesystem access, because they are no longer part of a long list.\nNote that the group list in the calling session does not get modified. You will see this if for example you type:\nmodule load jasmin-sci # a reminder of the setup command id # \u0026#34;id\u0026#34; reports your whole list of groups withgroups ukmo_clim id # \u0026#34;id\u0026#34; only reports the \u0026#34;ukmo_clim\u0026#34; group id # again, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34; will show you the whole group listThis means that you should use withgroups on every command for which it is needed. If you prefer to use a subshell in which every command will have this group(s) list (for similar behaviour to newgrp) you could start it by doing something like:\nwithgroups ukmo_clim bash(You might see from the help message that the withgroups command includes a -a option to include all the original groups in the group list, just with the specified ones at the front. However, this option is not recommended for this purpose, because it turns out that filesystem access will ignore the ordering and still truncate the list in numerical order.)\nUse of workarounds with python (and other) programs \u0026nbsp; Note that there is no python module equivalent of either newgrp or withgroups. In most cases, it is sufficient to run your whole python script either inside a newgrp session or via withgroups, for example:\nwithgroups ukmo_clim python my_script.pyIn the unlikely event that your Python program needs access to a large number of groups, you will have to lauch external commands (using os.system or the subprocess package) that start with the relevant withgroups prefix.\nSimilar considerations apply to code written in other programming languages."
