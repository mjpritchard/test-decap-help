 This article was originally written in 2018/19 to introduce new forms of storage which were brought into production at that stage. Some of the information and terminology is now out of date, pending further review of JASMIN documentation.
 &lt;/div>
 &lt;/div>
&lt;p>Workflows with some of the issues highlighted below will have a knock on
effect for other users, so please take the time to check and change your code
to make appropriate use of new storage system. If used correctly, the new
storage offers us a high performance scalable file system, with the capability
for object storage as tools and interfaces evolve, and we can continue to
serve the growing demand for storage in the most cost effective manner.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
